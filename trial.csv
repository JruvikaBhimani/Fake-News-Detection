(Before It's News)
The Toledo Mud Hens are back for the second time this season. That’s a very rare event, unprecendented in my experience, for an out-of-division team to visit twice in one year. At any rate, the Bulls and Mud Hens are 3 and 3 on the season.
The Mud Hens are in 3rd place in the IL West and their weakness certain appears to be their hitting. Otherwise, their base numbers are bad at all.
The Bulls, of course, are coming off a hitting gem, but pitching disaster yesterday.

",Usman Khawaja on struggles with racial sledging in Australian grade cricket,"Usman Khawaja has scored 1,728 runs in 24 Tests for Australia, including five centuries
Australia's Usman Khawaja says being racially abused as young players has stopped many overseas-born cricketers from playing for the country.
The 30-year-old, who was born in Pakistan, said such abuse culminated in him not supporting Australia teams.
""Getting sledged by opposition players and their parents was the norm,"" said Khawaja on the Players Voice website.
""Some of them said it just quietly enough for only me to hear. It still hurt, but I would never show it.""
Khawaja became the first Muslim to play Test cricket for Australia when he made his debut against England in 2011. He has scored 1,728 runs in 24 Tests, including five centuries.
""I was brought up to be respectful, humble and polite. But when I watched the Aussie team, I saw men who were hard-nosed, confident, almost brutish,"" he continued.
""The same type of men who would sledge me about my heritage growing up.
""It is for this reason why so many of my friends, most of whom were born outside Australia, didn't support Australia in sporting contests. I didn't either.""
He added: ""My point is this: it's no surprise it has taken Australia cricket so long for coloured players to come through the system.""
Khawaja, who was the only Asian at first-class level in Australia when he began playing for New South Wales, added that the situation has improved because ""youngsters are given a bit more support to nurture and grow as players"". He said this is ""paving the way for all cricketers from all ethnic, religious and socio-economic backgrounds"".
His article ended: ""Australian cricket is slowly changing and will finally have a chance to reflect what Australia really is - an international team truly representative of its richly diverse population.""",1

","After White House Issues Demands, Hopes for an Immigration Deal Dim","On Sunday night, the White House issued a “framework” for an immigration deal that would protect so-called “Dreamers,” undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. The demands included a wall across the southern border, 10,000 new immigration agents, tougher laws for those seeking asylum, the denial of federal grants to “sanctuary cities,” and an end to people bringing their extended family into the United States.

Even before those demands were issued, the solutions proliferating on Capitol Hill looked less like progress than testaments to Congress’s failure to come together, with five months left before the young immigrants previously protected by the Obama administration face possible deportation.
Democrats were sticking by the Dream Act, which has languished in Congress since it was introduced in 2001. Some Republicans were rallying around the less-generous Succeed Act, which has been rejected by many Democrats who would need to be on board for it to actually succeed. Another Republican senator introduced the Border Security and Deferred Action Recipient Relief Act, which twins border security and legalization for a fraction of the undocumented immigrants whom liberals have sought to protect.
None of those bills can now claim a majority in either chamber of Congress.
Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate Democratic leader, thought they were making progress with the president, who had appeared emotionally conflicted after he rescinded President Barack Obama’s order, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protected young immigrants.
Now they are not so sure.
“The $64,000 question is, is the president backing off what he said he would do to Leader Pelosi and I? And there are signs that he is,” Mr. Schumer said. “But what we are saying is very simple: If the president has changed his mind and if he’s doing an about-face from what he told us, he ought to say it now. Not just prolong this. We will try to find other ways to help the Dreamers.”
In an interview Monday, Ms. Pelosi said she didn’t think Mr. Trump had backed out of their dinnertime agreement, but she said she found every single White House demand released this weekend “harmful” and unacceptable.
Ms. Pelosi stressed that she wants a solution for young immigrants “much sooner” than December.
Representative Luis V. Gutiérrez, Democrat of Illinois, said Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi need to forget about their Chinese dinner with the president and fall back on a strong-armed tactic — the threat of a government shutdown.

“I hope the meal was grand because it is obvious today that Donald Trump is not keeping his word,” Mr. Gutiérrez said. “This is the glue that keeps them together, their adamant anti-immigrant policy, and you’re going to need a powerful political tool in order to dislodge them.”

Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, Democrat of New Mexico and the chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, called the White House’s demands “immoral.”
The back and forth between Democratic leaders and Mr. Trump — and the proliferating legislative responses — have revived memories of immigration failures in 2006, 2007 and 2015.
“It’s great to have legislation, but I want to see results,” said Art Acevedo, the chief of the Houston Police Department. “We’ve had legislation on a lot of good policies. But what we want is to see it passed.”
Tom Nassif, president of Western Growers, a company that produces about half of all produce across the United States, said he hopes that politicians will finally make a deal after weighing the economic and humanitarian fallout from deporting thousands of workers. But he did not sound optimistic.
“The jury is still out on whether they can get it done,” he said. “They haven’t proven they have been able to give and take and make compromises, whether it’s health care reform, or tax reform, or immigration reform.”

Democrats have said they would vote for some border security enhancements in exchange for the passage of legislation that mirrors the Dream Act, a bill introduced in 2001 by Senators Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. That bill allows undocumented immigrants with high school diplomas or general equivalency diplomas to become citizens if they attend college, work or serve in the military.
Republicans have put out their own plans. Last month, Senators Hatch, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma offered the Succeed Act, which would make immigrants wait longer than the Dream Act to both become citizens and to help other family members become legal residents. Both senators said their bill would need to be tied to a border security measure.

Then last week, Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, a longtime champion of bipartisan immigration legislation, put up what he called a compromise, the Border Security and Deferred Action Recipient Relief Act. That legislation, among other things, would provide $1.6 billion in funding for border security measures, such as fortifying structures and building roads. It would offer a path toward citizenship only for current DACA recipients and children who have been in the country since 2012, and would target gang members and drug cartels for deportation.
Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has been working with Mr. Durbin to push for a compromise on immigration, said he was “really, really happy to see so many Republicans weighing in.” But, he said, Republicans must realize that they will have to give up some of what they want.
“The one thing, I tell you, that we can’t do, in my view, is fail,” he said.
Jo Anne Lyon, who attended a conservative gathering of pro-immigration activists last week, put her faith in a higher authority after meeting several lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
“We need divine intervention for God to move people’s hearts,” Ms. Lyon said. “My prayer is, thaw the frozen hearts.”",1

","The Choose-Your-Own-Reality Theory of Terror, Mass Shootings and Spiritual Warfare","Op-Ed by Dylan Charles
By now, every possible angle of the Las Vegas shooting has been expounded upon by anyone with a website or a YouTube channel. Without a doubt, something doesn’t add up, but, we’ve gone through this before, many times now, and it never adds up.
And it won’t ever add up, because the self-proclaimed authorities will never acknowledge contrary points of view. They’ll never publicly admit that the official story doesn’t jibe with the totality of facts and thoughtful observations openly available to anyone with an Internet connection and a halfway open mind.
And so we never come to know the whole truth and nothing but the truth. These cases remain open forever. They fester on and on like incurable tumors in the psyche of the body politic, forever generating debate, discussion, discordance, disharmony, infighting, argument and anger. Forever pushing people into psychological traps where reality is whatever best fits with one’s chosen perspective, whatever that may be.
The power structures in place have a firm grip on the controls of the reality generation machine. It’s a top-down system. When an event like Las Vegas happens, the machine goes into action, spinning out variants and possibilities then tossing them into the ether of the collective consciousness. There, facts and fantasies are furiously pecked at and picked over until we’ve had our fill. Then we wait for the next feeding. The next blood-letting.
You see, the real powers in our world don’t care if we know the truth. They don’t care if in all of our theories we do happen to stumble upon the actual story. Their interests aren’t threatened by speculative chatter on the Internet. They’re not challenged by keyboard experts or social media warriors. They’re not afraid of homegrown video analysis and list articles pointing out the obvious. They’re not troubled by snarky know-it-all bloggers. To them we’re just a billion monkeys with a billion typewriters feverishly hoping to accidentally hammer out Homer’s Odyssey.
In fact, they love it when they know that we know. It’s a psychopath thing. You wouldn’t understand.
To the contrary, though. The insane flurry of pseudo-investigative journalism and professional-grade speculation serves them well. It deepens the divide. It stokes more anger, rage, impotency and confusion. It speeds up the fractionation of the public psyche into ever-finer opinion groups and ever-tighter echo chambers. It serves them well to niche us down into evermore subtle corrals of theoretics.
In our uber-connected, news-cycle-driven world, an event like Las Vegas is much more than just murder. It’s a wide detour for public awareness. And it’s a mega pay-day for everyone in the game.
Those pulling the trigger profit by selling us back our peace of mind in the form of security technologies and increased federal budgets for the alphabet agencies of the police state and the Orwellian permanent war tribe.
The 24-7 news teams cash in, too. They gain in audience share and up the price on their advertising space. The pundits get booked overtime presenting, framing, re-framing and re-packaging tidbits of info for public consumption. They sell dark fantasies about what could be and what might come to be, triggering the imagination, stirring up waves of cortisol then selling more pills and products to cope with it all.
The ever-growing body of independent websites and alt-news ventures get to take all this to the bank as well. Speculation is insatiably click-worthy. No one really knows what the hell is going on, but the clicks just keep on coming, so long as we can think of new ways of saying the same things. After all, clicks equal money, and who doesn’t want money? If the theory is just as discreditable as the official story, who cares?
The ritual of terrorism and mass murder events wouldn’t be what it is without the feeding frenzy of content creation, widespread speculation, conjecture, opinion generation, confidence games and outright bullshit. It’s part of the emotional roller coaster we so darkly love. It temporarily fills the void. It’s a little thing we do to feign purpose and meaning amidst our frustrating inability to substantively improve the human condition.
In this environment we are free to choose our own reality, to jump from ship to ship, subscribing and unsubscribing to whatever theory compliments our frame of mind and upholds up our tightly held worldview.
Meanwhile our attention is stolen and misdirected, trained onto the most terrifying of external fascinations. Higher consciousness is pissed into the wind. Love is plowed under by fear, and a spiritual illness metastasizes. The inner being continues to rot and disintegrate.
Suddenly there’s no time for holding space for the victims or for those directly affected. There’s no desire to consciously generate empathy. The task of ferreting out our own darkness and of rooting out our own anger and hate is put on hold for a wild goose chase in search of certainty and consensus. The bigger picture is totally lost in the sensational details of the horror.
The mind convinces itself that it can control the world by wrangling with external circumstances, and that its righteous duty is to submerge itself in the dark minutiae of shock and awe. The psyche is further conditioned to indulge in madness, and the spirit is further tricked into believing that fear has a rightful home in the heart.
It’s a trap within a trick. A tragedy built into a tragedy. A thousand rabbit holes within a rabbit hole. It’s a veil concealing the reality that the matrix is an attention funnel designed to direct our awareness and energy onto a pre-fab spread of pre-packaged, shitty realities. Where attention goes, energy flows. This is spiritual warfare. The enemy’s goal is for us to forget that we are creators of this world and that we have more power than we know what to do with.
This is the age of choose-your-own-reality. It is my suspicion that the world will begin to improve when we consciously enter into the age of create-your-own reality.

The ESPN host that last month called President Donald Trump a “white supremacist” on Twitter is doubling-down on her sports-related social justice activism by calling for a boycott of advertisers who align with Dallas Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones. Jemele Hill told fans to go after Cowboys sponsors after Jones publicly told players that he would bench them if they did not stand for the national anthem. “Change happens when advertisers are impacted,” Hill tweeted. “If you strongly reject what Jerry Jones said, the key is his advertisers.” If you strongly reject what Jerry Jones said, the key is his advertisers.

","Alternative Social Network Gab Faces Domain Seizure For Violating ""Anti-Discrimination Laws""","By Aaron Kesel
Alternative media social network Gab.ai, whose logo is a frog often used by the “alt right,” faces domain seizure for failing to remove content that vilifies “race, religion or ethnic origin.” Their registrar further implied that the site promotes hate and discrimination.
Gab’s domain registrar, Asia Registry, has given the network 5 days to transfer its domain or it will be seized according to a notice sent to the company, Andrew Torba Gab’s CEO tweeted out.
BREAKING: Gab’s domain registrar has given us 5 days to transfer our domain or they will seize it. The free and open web is in danger. pic.twitter.com/Irl6KO5Xmr — Gab (@getongab) September 18, 2017
This comes after Gab was contacted by its registrar to take down a post by the founder of the neo-Nazi site, Daily Stormer, Andrew Anglin.
The post by Anglin grotesquely mocked Charlottesville murder victim Heather Heyer, which Asia Registry told Torbha violated their abuse policy.
Torba noted in a Medium post that Gab previously has enforced its own guidelines and that the post did violate its own policy and was indeed obscene.
“This is not the first time we have enforced our guidelines. Gab has banned users for spamming, making death threats to the President, posting revenge porn, and doxing among others. We’ve been transparent and incredibly fair about this on many occasions,” Torba wrote.
Torba, who I personally interviewed before Gab’s start last year for We Are Change, expressed on Twitter that “The free and open web is in danger.”
This isn’t the first time Torba suggested what he saw as a “threat to the Internet.” During our interview he stated that “big social was moving to censor everyone and play the online thought police.”
He also highlighted that Gab’s site didn’t have “hate speech or harassment rules” because in this day and age that has become a “subjective definition.”
We have very simple guidelines. We don’t have anything like hate speech or harassment rules because in 2016 that type of stuff has largely become a subjective definition by whoever is deeming something hateful speech. So our guidelines are very simple. We have three: #1 no illegal pornography, #2. Zero tolerance policy for threats and terrorism. 3. No posting other users’ private information (d0xing).
He further stated that any organization defined as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government or the UN will be considered a terrorist organization on their end.
Gab just wrapped up its fundraising campaign last month tweeting “F*CK YOU Silicon Valley Elitist Trash,” thanking its users for a successful crowdfund in which the company raised 1 million dollars.
1 million dollars raised by THE PEOPLE to make speech free again and say FUCK YOU Silicon Valley elitist trash. Thank you all!!!!!!!! — Gab (@getongab) August 17, 2017
This comes as the Gab app was pulled from Google Play just last month after Google also accused the alternative free speech social network of “violating its hate speech policy.”
Breaking news: Google has removed Gab’s Android app from the Google Play Store for “hate speech.” pic.twitter.com/jPqeEx1ID1 — Gab (@getongab) August 17, 2017
“Google has pulled Gab’s Android app from the Google Play Store for ‘hate speech,’” wrote Andrew Torba, the creator of Gab. “This is war.”
Google isn’t the only one censoring the alternative social network, Apple also denied the app in its own Appstore stating it “included pornographic content” posted by users — despite how Twitter also features similar user-generated content.
Gab, in turn, is suing Google for what it calls “antitrust violations” arguing that the company violated antitrust laws when it rejected Gab’s app from its Android app store. Gab further went on to state, the decision to block its app from the Play Store “is intended to, and does, unlawfully protect the financial and strategic benefits it enjoys by virtue of its partnership with Twitter, Gab’s chief competitor, from other competitors.”
A Google spokesperson told Ars Technica that the claim was baseless and they were prepared to defend it in court.
This claim is baseless and we’re happy to defend our decision in court if need be,” a spokesperson wrote. “In order to be on the Play Store, social networking apps need to demonstrate a sufficient level of moderation, including for content that encourages violence and advocates hate against groups of people. This is a long-standing rule and clearly stated in our developer policies. This developer is welcome to appeal the suspension if they’ve addressed the policy violations and are compliant with our Developer Program Policies.
As for Apple, Gab states they are practicing a double standard and they intend to appeal the decision:
“This clear double standard against us is potentially politically motivated and clearly targeted,” Gab said in its post. “When you actively search for something on a user-generated website, chances are you’re going to find what you are looking for.”
Torba plans to bring Gab to the blockchain which will inevitably “give the power and control to The People and make the internet censorship-proof.”
“Gab wants to lead the creation of the next level of the internet. If Web 2.0 was about centralized, social, and mobile networks: Web 3.0 will be a decentralized, blockchain-based, radically transparent, people-powered internet infrastructure,” Torba concluded.

","NFL Teams Stayed in Locker Rooms For Anthem Until 2009-Then DoD Began ""Paying for Patriotism""","By Jay Syrmopoulos
President Trump’s condemnation of NFL players who choose to kneel, rather than stand for the national anthem, reignited a national debate that began with Colin Kaepernick’s decision not to stand for the anthem last season as a protest against police brutality.
Over the weekend a plethora of players and even entire teams chose to either kneel or stay in the locker room during the playing of the national anthem – while many NFL owners released statements of support for players who choose not to stand.
What many people are missing in this debate is the fact that prior to 2009, NFL teams did not generally stand for the anthem. While having the option to do so individually if they chose to, most of the time they stayed in the locker room during this pregame ritual.
In fact, Tom E. Curran of Comcast Sportsnet New England reported, in August 2016, that NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed that the now common practice of players standing on the field together for the national anthem only began in 2009.
NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed this morning the practice began in 2009, adding, ‘As you know, the NFL has a long tradition of patriotism. Players are encouraged but not required to stand for the anthem.’
Additionally, it has come to light that many of the “patriotic” pregame displays in the NFL are simply propaganda displays that were paid for by the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Guard – meaning that these displays were actually paid for by the American taxpayers.
These displays of patriotic propaganda, called “paid patriotism,” were brought to light in April 2015, when Arizona Senator Jeff Flake released a statement condemning the practice.
Then in November 2015, Flake and fellow Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain issued a report stating that the U.S. Department of Defense had been paying the NFL for patriotic displays in football and other sports between 2011 and 2014:
Contrary to the public statements made by DOD and the NFL, the majority of the contracts — 72 of the 122 contracts we analyzed — clearly show that DOD paid for patriotic tributes at professional football, baseball, basketball, hockey, and soccer games. These paid tributes included on-field color guard, enlistment and reenlistment ceremonies, performances of the national anthem, full-field flag details, ceremonial first pitches͕ and puck drops. The National Guard paid teams for the “opportunity” to sponsor military appreciation nights and to recognize its birthday. It paid the Buffalo Bills to sponsor its Salute to the Service game. DOD even paid teams for the “opportunity” to perform surprise welcome home promotions for troops returning from deployments and to recognize wounded warriors. While well intentioned, we wonder just how many of these displays included a disclaimer that these events were in fact sponsored by the DOD at taxpayer expense. Even with that disclosure, it is hard to understand how a team accepting taxpayer funds to sponsor a military appreciation game, or to recognize wounded warriors or returning troops, can be construed as anything other than paid patriotism.
In total, the Department of Defense paid 14 NFL teams $5.4 million from 2011 to 2014 for patriotic propaganda during NFL games.
U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) called the spending wasteful spending that “leaves a bad taste in your mouth”:
“Those of us go to sporting events and see them honoring the heroes,” Flake said in an interview. “You get a good feeling in your heart. Then to find out they’re doing it because they’re compensated for it, it leaves you underwhelmed. It seems a little unseemly.” “They realize the public believes they’re doing it as a public service or a sense of patriotism,” Flake continued. “It leaves a bad taste in your mouth.”
Former congressman Ron Paul released a video condemning the practice, asking,
Do you know why the NFL has become so gung-ho with military propaganda? It’s because the U.S. government pays them to do it! So, our money is taken from us, and given to the NFL, in order to propagandize us to support the Empire’s wars. That has to stop.
The report by Senators Flake and McCain did not cover the years prior to 2011, thus having no way to verify whether this “paid patriotism” program began in 2009 – the year NFL teams began taking to the field as a team for the national anthem. However, logic would seem to indicate that it was not an organic manifestation given the widespread proclivity of teams and players to stay in the locker room during the anthem—for decades—prior to 2009.
The fact that all the teams in the NFL decided during the 2009 season to start coming to the field early for the national anthem seems to indicate that these actions, which were the exact behaviors pushed for in the “paid patriotism” propaganda program, were not organic, but begun as part of the Department of Defense propaganda program.
And, while the public argues over whether or not players should stand or kneel, there is no debate that this is government-sponsored propaganda that is meant to indoctrinate people into supporting an imperial war machine that fights not for America and freedom, but for geopolitical power, access to energy resources, and hegemonic control of the global economic system as predicated by the petrodollar.
Please share this story to help awaken people to the fact that these “patriotic” displays are actually “paid patriotism” propaganda brought to you by the U.S. Department of Defense!

","Review: In ‘The Departure,’ Watching Over Those Who Flirt With Death","Photo
Sad, tender and quietly moving, “The Departure” never says more than it needs to, much like its subject, a Buddhist priest who counsels those contemplating suicide.
The documentary, directed by Lana Wilson, follows Ittetsu Nemoto, who after a troubled adolescence became a monk, then a priest, in Japan. He settled with his wife, child and mother at a temple in Gifu prefecture where he spends nearly all his time trying to dissuade those in danger of taking their own lives.
The men and women here convey deep torment and helplessness. Mr. Nemoto occasionally asks questions, gives advice or offers reasons to live. But more often he listens, and his face registers both empathy for them and sometimes despair at his own shortcomings. “I’m sorry,” he says softly to one troubled woman as he looks away. “I’m not being much help, am I?”
Video
His nearness to their pain takes a toll. Mr. Nemoto’s health declines as the unceasing calls and emails he receives wear on him. “I take on so much of their suffering when I’m counseling,” he says. “I can never show them how draining is it.”
Ms. Wilson resists any urge to overexplain the priest’s work or the people he encounters. Instead, she captures their forlorn expressions and records their searching questions. (Viewers seeking additional background on Mr. Nemoto can find it in an excellent article from The New Yorker by Larissa MacFarquhar, which inspired this film.) Nathan Michel’s score is haunting.
Like a haiku, “The Departure” weighs its words carefully. But silences, too, play a vital role here. During its quiet moments, we can only watch this priest comfort the despaired and hope that he succeeds.",1

Sticking a kid in front of the morning cartoons may carry a whiff of stigma now, but it’s just as easy as it ever was. Also, it’s free. Partly because children’s podcast creators are claiming the moral high ground on screen time, advertising is controversial for the medium. Pinna is charging $7.99 a month for its ad-free offerings. Whether parents will pay up remains to be seen.

Andy Bowers, Panoply’s chief content officer, has been puzzling over how to turn children’s audio into a sustainable enterprise for a couple of decades. Before he created Slate’s podcast network and spun it off into its own business, Panoply, he spent 17 years in public radio, where he tried unsuccessfully to evangelize for kids’ programming.
The conventional wisdom for radio stations was to stick with just one format — music or news. Producers were loath to abandon their dedicated adult audiences and try to wrangle children in front of the radio for an hour a day. So in 2005, just as the podcast was emerging as a form, Mr. Bowers started his own homemade kids’ show with his 5-year-old daughter, Emma, taping episodes in a closet of their house.
“Molly and the Sugar Monster” is a charming a bit of reverse psychology: It features Mr. Bowers as an ornery monster who urges kids to eat junk food, and Emma as a wily kid who taunts him with tales of her vegetable consumption until he explodes in frustration.
Now the series has found a home on Pinna, where it’s been packaged along with a trove of exclusive audio content. Emma Bowers, now 17, collaborated with Mr. Bowers on an original “sound picture book” for the app, “Kid Wash,” which used a binaural recording system — a mold of a human head outfitted with microphones — to create a 3-D listening experience that feels unlike anything children can read or watch.
In addition to snackable audio for younger children, Pinna offers longer, serialized narratives like “Remy’s Place,” an “Eloise”-style series about a boy who lives above a Brooklyn juke joint (created by “Blue’s Clues” composer Michael Rubin), and “Season Isle,” a fantasy series about twins living on an enchanted island. Pinna also snagged Gen-Z Media’s follow-up to “Mars Patel,” the paranormal mystery “The Ghost of Jessica Majors.”

Nonfiction content includes the kid’s trivia game show “ExtraBLURT,” the sports talk show “Good Sport!” and “The Show About Science.” Come November, Pinna will debut a choose-your-own-adventure podcast and, in December, a series styled like an advent calendar, with an episode dropping each day leading up to Christmas.
Podcasts creators aren’t just selling content; they’re pitching a lifestyle shift. “Because kids weren’t valued as an audience in radio, I think there’s an assumption that kids don’t listen to audio, or they can’t stay engaged by it,” said Lindsay Patterson, co-chair of Kids Listen and the host of the children’s science podcast Tumble.
Even NPR’s first podcast for kids, “Wow in the World,” was personally financed by its hosts, Mr. Raz and Mindy Thomas, who record the show on nights and weekends in Ms. Thomas’s basement studio in Fairfax, Va. (It’s paid off: Since its launch in May, “Wow and the World” has sat at the top of podcast rankings for kid and family content, racking up more than 3.6 million downloads.) “The Unexplainable Disappearance of Mars Patel,” which debuted last year, was the “Serial” of children’s podcasts and proved that serialized audio narratives could catch on among younger audiences.

Podcast makers are hoping that as more and better content is made available, audio listening will become another family ritual, like reading books at bedtime or listening to kids’ albums in the car. One of Pinna’s marketing pitches is an attempt to establish new habits: “It’s for car time, play time, family time, chore time, bed time, any time.”
But unlike with YouTube channels or mobile games, children don’t yet have an easy way to discover podcasts on their own. Even the “Kids & Family” section of iTunes is peppered with often-inappropriate content for couples and parents. Dedicated apps for children’s podcasts — in addition to Pinna, Kids Listen offers its own app for surfacing children’s content, as does a new app called Leela Kids — seeks to streamline that discovery process. “Four-year-olds, these days, will be very fluent in their use of the app,” Ms. Shapiro said.
To help encourage the new habit, podcasters are leaning on some light shaming. As Matt Lieber, co-founder of the podcast company Gimlet Media, said at a panel on the state of podcasting last year, “The guilt of a parent who puts the television on to pacify their children is one of the most powerful emotional forces in existence.” (Gimlet, too, has a show for kids in the works.)
Mr. Raz and Ms. Thomas have started their own company, Tinkercast, to expand their podcasting brand under the tagline: “Eyes Up. Screens Down. Jaws Dropped.” Panoply bills Pinna as “Screen free. Ad free. Guilt free.” It’s a tantalizing idea: a technological fix that feels like a throwback. “What we’re doing is not groundbreaking,” Mr. Raz said. “This is old-fashioned, old-school technology.”
Partly because kids’ podcasts are trying to situate themselves as a more virtuous alternative to screen time, advertising to kids is a sticky issue. In the grown-up world, podcasters typically appeal to advertisers with boundless editorial flexibility; marketing pitches are often written, produced and performed by the hosts themselves.

But research suggests that children respond to ads differently than adults do; they are less likely to differentiate between ads and other forms of entertainment, and they implicitly trust marketers’ claims. “You just can’t shove as much advertising into a kids’ show as you can into a show for adults,” said Ms. Patterson of Kids Listen. “Too many ads will turn parents off.”
On “Wow in the World,” Mr. Raz and Ms. Thomas have opted to aim commercials at the parents who are listening in. Before a break, a child’s voice announces: “Grown-ups, this message is for you,” and then an adult voice-over artist reads ads for parent stuff like a meal-kit service or a sock start-up. Meanwhile, Panoply is hoping that parents will pay $7.99 a month for the ad-free Pinna. “I just think it’s coercive,” said Mr. Bowers of advertising to kids. To reach a broader audience, Pinna will also offer select episodes of its shows for free; those won’t have ads, either.
If podcasters manage to capture the kids’ market, they stand to create podcast listeners for life. James Kee, the 7-year-old fan of “Wow in the World”, has already started branching out to more advanced fare. “I’ve listened to a little bit of ‘Pod Save America,’” he said.",1

",Frontline examines 'North Korea's Deadly Dictator',"(CNN) Mixing the tense international situation with the qualities of a spy thriller, ""Frontline's"" latest documentary, ""North Korea's Deadly Dictator,"" provides what's described as ""a rare glimpse"" inside Kim Jong Un's regime, as well as the bizarre circumstances surrounding the assassination of his half-brother in a Malaysian airport.
Framed by President Trump's U.N. speech in which he belittled the North Korean leader as ""Rocket Man,"" the PBS program explores Kim's ruthlessness through the murder of Kim Jong Nam, but also offers dimension regarding his nuclear ambitions while expressing skepticism that Kim is irrational or suicidal.
The New Yorker's Evan Osnos, meanwhile, who recently reported extensively from inside North Korea, notes that officials there are ""mystified"" by Trump's threat to unleash ""fire and fury,"" underscoring the inherent risks of employing what President Nixon called the ""madman theory"" as a means of gaining leverage against rogue states.
Much of the hour is devoted to the killing of Kim Jong Nam, who had lived in the west and was killed in February when he was poisoned with VX nerve agent. The strange mechanics included enlisting two women who claim they were duped into carrying out the brazen plot in plain view. The women pleaded not guilty in a Malaysian court on Monday.
"" allowfullscreen>
Beyond the strange details, the murder highlights both the family's longstanding grip on the country and just how thorny it is seeking to understand North Korea through the prism of more conventional nuclear powers. As Ken Gause, the director of CNA's International Affairs Group, puts it, this is a country ""ruled by individuals; it's not ruled by institutions.""

The final tally for 2017 is 64-98 (.395), 40 games out of first place and 23 games behind the wildcard. The Giants tie the Detroit Tigers for the worst record and will get rewarded with the number two overall pick in the 2018 June draft (the Giants had a better 2016 record than the Tigers).
It was a season in which everything went wrong. The team was a disaster from the opening bell and never found its footing. Considering the expectations and track record you could argue it was the worst season ever for the San Francisco Giants. The team was 16th of the 30 ML squads in runs allowed per game (4.79); they were 29th in runs scored per game (3.94). The league average for RA/RS was 4.65, I think you can see the problem. They couldn’t hit and the pitching was sub-par. They also couldn’t play the field or run the bases. The only players on the club with anything close to their expected performances were Buster Posey (.320/.400/.462, 4.3 fWAR) and Jeff Samardzija (207-2/3 IP, 3.8 fWAR).
One of the things about being a sports fan is that the outcomes are random. If you like movies of a particular ilk, say rom-coms or super-hero franchises, you can pick those when you go out and you will stand a good chance of getting your money’s worth. If you go to the circus or to the opera you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. Sporting events don’t give us that luxury. You have to take a risk–the performance could be a dud. Imagine if Broadway musicals had the variation we see in ballgames. Tuesday night’s Hamilton could really stink but Sunday’s would be epic, for example. Who would stand such a thing?
What we learn in life is to take the bitter with the sweet. There’s no way to separate the bad from the good as the world is all jumbled up. It’s not neat out there, it’s messy, and it can’t be untangled. We love the Giants so they drive us crazy. If we didn’t care it would be a lot easier. But we do, so it isn’t. We cry “wait ’til next year” when things are bleak. The 2018 Giants may be bad, or they may bounce back, there’s no way to know for sure. One thing I’m sure of is that I’ll be right here, chiming in on my beloved orange-and-blackers, and hoping you’ll join me.
As always, my heartfelt thanks to all of you for reading, lurking, commenting, and posting. This is our 10th full season of blogging here at RMC, that’s over 2200 posts! Writing about the Giants has taught me much about myself. It’s brought into focus my lifelong relationship to baseball, allowed me to muse often on the nature of fandom, and forced me to ride out the highs and lows with some degree of equanimity. I can’t wait to see what next year brings.
–M.C.
p.s. Baseball is a slow, sluggish game with frequent and trivial interruptions, offering the spectator many opportunities to reflect at leisure upon the situation on the field. This is what a fan loves most about the game. –Edward Abbey (from Vox Clamantis in Deserto )

",Betting on CS GO With Bitcoin,"Betting on CS GO With Bitcoin
(Before It's News)
Betting on CS GO with Bitcoin
Online gambling can go two ways: it can either be extremely safe or become very risky. It all depends on the laws of the country or state that you reside in. Some countries don’t care about where you’re putting your money while others may just throw you in jail simply because you bet a penny on a Counter Strike GO match.
Take, for instance, the United States. Since gambling is outlawed, most people might prefer turning to the privacy offered by Bitcoin rather than going for traditional currency.
What Is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is basically money that you buy with money. Since it works pretty much as if you just bought something online from whatever website, how you use the product should be of no concern to anyone. As a result, you could use the bitcoins for esports Bitcoin betting.
However, it’s still tricky. Law enforcement learned this trick and is sometimes “stalking” for Bitcoin users as well. Traditional or online, bitcoins are still coins – and therefore, it’s still considered money. As a result, you may sometimes have to download the betting software to evade any prying eyes.
Why Go for Bitcoins When Playing CS GO?
There are many advantages to using Bitcoin in eSport betting. A Bitcoin gaming website, for instance, is much faster. When you use traditional currencies, most of the time you’d have to wreck your nerves to make the payment official. Introduce your details, get your acceptance, make your transaction, ensure that it’s legal; this may be just enough to make you lose interest in the betting session and miss the match in the meantime.
With bitcoin, however, you will only have to sign up using your email address. You will rarely find any other transaction processing fees, which means that the whole ordeal will be done rather quickly.
Furthermore, if it’s not legal in your country – you can make it legal. The wonderful thing about the Internet is the fact that it spreads worldwide – and that includes countries where online gambling is not considered an issue.
As a result, you may be a US player struggling with the laws of your state – but you could still be accepted on an outer website that allows players from the US. Since the website is not based on US grounds, you may not be bound by the law.
Here’s the kicker: if you used the traditional money, making the transaction would be all the more troublesome – you’d either have to make the conversion or hide from the law enforcement the fact that you’re betting on a game using your bank account. With bitcoin, however, most problems are done with. Bitcoins represent universal gaming currency – so regardless of the country, you won’t have to go through many struggles. It’s the same money, but less of a headache.
Winning CS GO Skins
Why do we bet during our Counter Strike GO game plays? It’s quite simple. We never really bet because we want to cash in the money and use it in real life; we bet because we want to use that money in the virtual world. We want to buy the skins and weapons necessary to win the tournaments that CS GO launches from time to time.
Well, some betting websites want to make things even simpler for us. Instead of playing for money, you are playing for skins. They may only look fashionable and fancy, but they are great help when it comes to protecting your hero in a CS GO gameplay.
These skins are also valuable in the real world. You can trade them for all you want – cash or bitcoins. The choice of how you use the winnings is pretty much yours. We bet on CS GO because we want to be the winners – so no matter if you use the prize to pimp your hero or pay your bread, you have all the freedom. eSport betting is convenient this way.
We are all gamblers – at least to some extent. If we don’t take the risk, we don’t win. Even when your take your hero in CS GO to some dark tavern, you take a risk – you have no idea who might creep up on you and end your game.
When you are betting with Bitcoin, there’s still some risk – but the focus is on the risk of losing the bet rather than the risk of getting caught and thrown in jail. It’s a method that is supposed to make your gaming experience a little more enjoyable – and less stressful. It will be lucrative and entertaining at the same time and, if you are lucky, it will also be rewarding. Give CS GO betting a try and may the odds be forever in your favor!",0

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian tycoons Mikhail Prokhorov and Viktor Vekselberg have sold a 3 percent stake in Russian aluminum giant Rusal via an accelerated bookbuilding (ABB) for $315 million, one of their bookrunners said on Wednesday.
The deal came less than a week after Russia’s En+ Group, which owns a 48 percent stake in Rusal, said it would launch an initial public share offering in London and Moscow.
The ABB offering of about 456 million shares was priced at the lower end of the range of HK$5.40-HK$5.55‍​ with a 7.5-percent discount to the pre-deal market price, the bookrunner said.‍​
Rusal shares fell 7 percent in Hong Kong on Wednesday, but are still up more than 65 percent since the start of 2017.
Prokhorov sold 0.7 percent in Hong Kong-listed Rusal and Vekselberg sold 2.3 percent, reducing their stakes in the company to 6 percent and 20.5 percent, respectively. Goldman Sachs and Renaissance Capital were the joint bookrunners.
The deal could increase the liquidity of Rusal’s shares in Moscow and make it easier for Rusal to be included in the prestigious MSCI Russia Index, investment bank BCS has said.
Assuming that the placement was made into an open market, the free float of Rusal has increased to 16.4 percent, but its inclusion in the MSCI index in November is unlikely, VTB Capital said in a note on Wednesday.
The company may get into the index in May, subject to the liquidity of its shares in Moscow and MSCI’s goodwill, it added.",1

Listen: https://youtu.be/m-awJ5TqriU Oh So Real is a brutally honest, dark urban banger, courtesy of the forever flow-etic Tubby Boy and the vocally unmistakable Telboy. Oh So Real is lyrically themed on observations surrounding some of the music industry's aspiring artists and their lack of realness, desperate attempts at recognition and inflated self-worth. All of this popping off on a deep, heavy beat that sounds like a south London borough had passed through a recording studio in Houston or Atlanta. As per usual, Tubby Boy never fails to deliver effortless flows, and his performance on Oh So Real is no exception. His bars are packed full of wit, metaphors and references, the whole time consciously raising the underlying point of the song. That's when the one and only Telboy takes the mic, full of soul and authentic style, to lyrically develop the theme and perfectly summarize the plot with his unforgettable hook.

Caspar McCloud, virtuoso guitarist and vocalist, has just released his first acoustic album, unveiling to the world what close friends, church members, and conference attendee's have previously only been able to enjoy in person. Caspar's album, titled Pictures of Jesus – Acoustic Worship, features 14 originals, with heartfelt, thoughtfully rendered lyrics and acoustic guitar. The vocals show the strength, maturity and gentle power of his emotions from song to song. The album tastefully features numerous shining examples of Caspar's unmatched guitar solo abilities woven throughout every track; the care, attention, and composition all prevail as a display of musicianship that comes only from a seasoned professional. Caspar's recording career goes back to earlier days as a signed Atlantic Records recording artist, through many years of album releases in his name and with his band Ministry of Three. Pictures of Jesus - Acoustic Worship provides the listener with the first opportunity to hear the simple, refined nature of his talent without the amplifiers and larger-than-life band elements of past releases. This is a rare glimpse into genius in its most exposed, direct, and masterfully polished form. ""The past several years I have been asked to speak and play at a number of conferences, events and churches..."" Caspar shares. ""Playing without my band meant singing my songs playing my acoustic guitar whilst exploring new realms of possibilities without other musicians. Ludwig van Beethoven was once quoted as saying 'The guitar is a miniature orchestra in itself.' Over the last few years numerous people, including my good friend Trey Smith (God in A Nutshell) have greatly encouraged me by asking when will there be a recording of these acoustic songs you have played for us? My long time friend and fellow artist, musician, erudite theologian, and software inventor Michael Angel took on the task of producing my first all acoustic album which shall be released in a few days time.” Pictures of Jesus – Acoustic Worship is available through all major online distributors and will release via CD shortly after launch.

Raiders Throw Game to Punish QB Who Wouldn’t Protest Trump – Where Is Roger Goodell Now?
After the NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell turned zealot and decided Patriots QB Tom Bradey must be punished for someone under-inflating a game ball by –1.5 lbs. of pressure, and for Tom Brady being unable to discern this from holding a frozen ball in the middle of January in the middle of the Super Bowl, he should be suspended on absolutely zero evidence, we will see where he stands on an entire offensive line throwing a game due to racial and political divides that NFL players have decided to drag the league. I personally will not watch another pro football game for the rest of my life. I am not kidding you.
Goodwell has now come out on the side of the players who protested Trump and threw a football game so as to draw attention away from this scandal by calling Trump devisive. Is there any doubt Goodwell is a moral coward? If hypocrisy is the respect that vice pays to virtue, Goodwell has now paid enough to bankrupt the entire NFL.
Below is the full story for which there is tons of ample direct and circumstantial evidence. Where is Goodwell now? Will he be too much of a coward to deal with the situation that threatens to destroy the NFL? There is much more evidence for this than there ever was for going after Tom Brady. Now everyone will act as if this criminal matter never took place because they simple don’t have the nerve to follow their own rules and standards when it really counts. It is so much easier to go after one white man than it is to go after an entire offensive line of African-Americans corrupting the game of football due to their political affiliations and protests against America. If Goodwell does nothing, Americans ought to protest en mass.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s prime minister sees scope for further reform of the country’s energy sector and has received “focused suggestions” from some of the world’s leading energy companies, the office of the premier said on Monday.
Under Narendra Modi, the world's third-biggest oil consumer is trying to use its market size to strike better deals with oil exporters and attract investment into India's exploration and refining industries. (reut.rs/2kxQxUi)
Executives from companies including Rosneft, BP, Exxon Mobil, Reliance Industries, Saudi Aramco, Royal Dutch Shell, Vedanta, Schlumberger and Halliburton met Modi as the industry gathered in New Delhi for the three-day India Energy Forum, which finishes on Tuesday.
“Participants appreciated the pace and drive with which Prime Minister Modi has brought about reform in the energy sector,” Modi’s office said in a statement after the meeting.
“Subjects such as the need for a unified energy policy, contract frameworks and arrangements, requirement of seismic data sets, encouragement for biofuels, improving gas supply, setting up of a gas hub and regulatory issues came up for discussion.”
The statement said that many suggestions at the last meeting in 2016 have helped guide Indian policy-making and that Modi said he appreciated the “focused suggestions” made this year and that “scope for reform in many areas still exists”.
Modi was quoted as saying he looked forward to “various opportunities” for cooperation between India and Saudi Arabia, the second biggest oil exporter to the country behind Iraq.
State-run Saudi Aramco, which on Sunday launched a new office near New Delhi, is in talks with several Indian refiners for a possible joint venture by next year.
Its Chief Executive Amin Nasser told the conference after the Modi meeting that India’s oil demand would double by 2040 to about 10 million barrels per day, making it the world’s largest market for the fuel and a priority for the company.
In the meeting, Modi thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin and Rosneft for their support to India’s energy sector. The two leaders were instrumental in helping to seal Rosneft’s $12.9 billion acquisition of India’s debt-laden Essar Oil, strengthening ties between the world’s largest oil producer and the fastest-growing fuel consumer.
In another vote of confidence for India’s energy sector, BP and Reliance have previously said they would jointly invest $6 billion to boost India’s gas output. A BP executive said on Monday that the company was “excited about gas, upstream and digital innovation in India”.
Alay Patel, a senior analyst with consultancy Wood Mackenzie, the global president of which also met Modi, said that India’s domestic energy production outlook was positive thanks to steps such as a simplified licensing regime and clarity on contracts.
“But more is needed,” said Patel. “Allowing marketing and pricing freedom for all gas production, regardless of shore status and contract vintage, would incentivize companies to develop gas in the less explored basins.”",1

",Trump threatens broadcaster NBC after nuclear report,"Image copyright AFP Image caption President Trump criticised NBC's report as he welcomed Canada's prime minister to the White House
US President Donald Trump has raised the prospect of challenging media licences for NBC News and other news networks after unfavourable reports.
He took aim at NBC, which made him a star on The Apprentice, after it reported he wanted to boost America's nuclear arsenal almost tenfold.
Mr Trump labelled the report ""fake news"" and ""pure fiction"".
NBC also angered the White House last week when it said the secretary of state had called Mr Trump ""a moron"".
Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning: ""With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!""
Welcoming Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Washington later in the day, the US president denied the NBC story.
""It is frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write, and people should look into it,"" he said at the White House.
When asked if he wanted to increase the country's arsenal, Mr Trump said he only ever discussed keeping it in ""perfect condition"".
""No, I want to have absolutely perfectly maintained - which we are in the process of doing - nuclear force.

""But when they said I want 10 times what we have right now, it's totally unnecessary, believe me.""
He added: ""I want modernisation and I want total rehabilitation. It's got to be in tip-top shape.""
Defence Secretary Jim Mattis also disputed NBC's story.
""Recent reports that the President called for an increase in the US nuclear arsenal are absolutely false,"" he said in a statement.
""This kind of erroneous reporting is irresponsible.""
The president's tweet about US broadcast networks provoked a free-speech uproar.
Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a frequent Trump critic, tweeted: ""Mr President: Are you recanting of the Oath you took on Jan 20 to preserve, protect, and defend the 1st Amendment?""
Walter Shaub, who led the US Office of Government Ethics under President Barack Obama, said it could lead to ""the point when we cease to be a democracy"".
The Committee to Protect Journalists said the US president's comment was a poor example for other world leaders.
According to NBC News, Mr Trump told a top-level meeting at the Pentagon in July that he wanted to dramatically boost the American stockpile of atomic missiles.
He reportedly made the request after seeing a downward-sloping curve on a briefing slide charting the gradual decrease in US nuclear weapons since the 1960s.
Attributing its report to three officials in the room, NBC said Mr Trump's request surprised those present, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

The network reported that Mr Trump had also called for additional US troops and military equipment.
The US has 7,100 nuclear weapons and Russia has 7,300, according to the US non-partisan Arms Control Association.
Media commentators say the president would struggle to remove broadcasters' licences if he wished to do so.
The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates US broadcasters, issues licences not to networks as a whole, but to local stations.
NBC owns nearly 30 local stations.
It would be difficult to challenge a licence on the basis that coverage is unfair, say pundits.
Trump's unworkable threat
Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter
Last week, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders assured reporters that Donald Trump was an ""incredible advocate"" of constitutional free-press protections. This week, the president is contemplating whether a broadcaster could be forced off the airwaves because he doesn't approve of its news coverage.
Never mind that the federal government licenses local televisions stations, only some of which are owned by national broadcasters like NBC.
Just because a threat is unworkable in the extreme doesn't mean the president won't make it.
Media-bashing is one of Mr Trump's favourite pastimes - a means of venting frustration, apportioning blame and, perhaps, distracting reporters who always enjoy a bit of journalistic navel-gazing.
As with the NFL anthem-kneeling controversy, the cultural battle lines form quickly when it comes to questions of media bias. The president knows this and uses it to his advantage.
Taking pot-shots at journalists is one thing, of course. Contemplating the use of government coercion to stifle a broadcaster because of its news content is another.
Even if such an outcome is unthinkable in the US at the moment, there are places in the world where press freedoms aren't as deeply entrenched. Their leaders are watching the president, too.",1

","Journalist Travels To North Korea, Brings Back Photos Very Different From MSM","By Brandon Turbeville
As the United States continues to drum up support for possible military intervention in North Korea, the propaganda attacks launched against the isolated Asian nation by the mainstream corporate press have intensified as well. Ranging from the semi-legitimate to the ridiculously absurd, the corporate media has launched a campaign of insults balanced only by its “resistance movement” to Donald Trump. In this case, however, Trump has the rare backing of the corporate press if only in the by the fact that the media is cheering for war harder and faster than Trump is perhaps willing to give it to them.
The corporate press has presented the entirety of North Korea as a state in which no independent thought is allowed, starvation is rampant, haircuts are mandated, and the population of the country is essentially kept in a massive prison camp with messages of brainwashing piped in to every home.
Yet, in the middle of all the propaganda and the talk of war, one journalist, Eva Bartlett, actually traveled to North Korea to get a firsthand impression and on-the-ground grasp of just what North Korea looks like, a sense of the culture, and what is on the minds of North Koreans. The pictures, videos, and stories she brought back with her tell a much different story than what is being portrayed on the screens of Western media.
While this writer is not attempting to paint North Korea as a utopian land of plenty and bastion of personal freedom, presentations of the country that are alternative to what corporate media outlets have portrayed cannot be ignored. After all, the Western media has repeatedly demonized and lied about nation after nation on the list slated for Western invasion and destruction. From Saddam’s incubator babies, Ghaddafi’s Viagra jihad, and Assad’s killing his own people, lie after lie has led the gullible American public to war. Unfortunately, only after the fact have the lies been exposed on a massive scale.
On August 24, Eva Bartlett and a handful of other activists and journalists entered North Korea as a delegation for the purpose of hearing what North Koreans had to say about their country, their culture, and the constant threat of war from the United States. They stayed in North Korea from the 24th to the 31st.
The photos that Bartlett returned with show impressive, ornate infrastructure that rivals anything in the United States and modern cities with clean and relatively content people. It shows a country that can indeed keep the lights on. The level to which Pyongyang has been rebuilt and developed after a war that saw the entirety of the city destroyed and nearly twenty percent of the North Korean population killed, truly stands in contrast to the portrayal by State Department and its media mouthpieces.
I highly encourage the reader to access and peruse Batrlett’s article “Photos From A Week In The DPRK,” where she has posted a collection of photographs taken on her trip to North Korea as well as a series of videos.
Bartlett has also posted a number of photos and videos showing the streets of Pyongyang full of people, in contrast to the propaganda that the city never has any civilians in it coming from many Western circles.
While corporate media outlets have used recycled smuggled footage of North Korean ghettos, starving orphans, starving people, and other gritty aspects, Eva Bartlett was able to bring back pictures of a country with excellent infrastructure, plenty of food, healthcare, and a people who, in her words, were not in any way “cowed.” Bartlett praised the level of education that the children in the schools that she visited as above the level of anything the United States or Canada is able to provide and was even able to take a few rides on the roller coaster at the amusement park in Pyongyang.
Bartlett describes a country full of people who want peace with the United States but who are not afraid of the U.S., nor are they afraid of defending themselves should that war come.
As Phil Taylor, with whom Bartlett conducted an interview that I recommend the reader take a listen to, stated,
North Korea does not exist in black and white. Witness Eva Bartlett’s photos and be struck by the colour. Despite a barrage of propaganda designed to portray a monochromatic dystopia, North Korea is a vibrant country populated by real human beings. Phil interviews Eva, whose timely voyage to the DPRK shines a light on a land darkened by our own ignorance.
Clearly, North Korea is authoritarian and it would not be considered a free country by any reasonable standards. The question of large-scale prison camps, labor camps, and the crackdown on political dissent still exist. Its experiment with socialism alone has resulted in the curtailment of many rights. However, in 2017, how many countries could be considered genuinely free? The United States with the largest prison population in the world? France and Germany with their thought crime legislation? China with its slave labor and toxic soil? Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
North Korea has, however, managed to stay free from Western central banking and the dictates of the Anglo-European financier system and, for this reason, it has found itself in the crosshairs of the imperial West.
At the end of the day, however, it doesn’t matter whether or not the propaganda surrounding North Korea is true. What matters is that the United States give up on the foolish adventure of imperialism and its current job as the hammer and fist of the Western banking establishment. From the point of view of the United States, North Korea’s internal question of freedom and democracy should be irrelevant. North Korea’s internal issues are just that – internal issues – and they should be decided by the North Korean people.
Regardless of the questions of whether or not North Korea is truly a free society, Eva Bartlett’s recent trip has cut through much of the intense propaganda surrounding the country in the run up to war and the constant need to use North Korea as a tool for the strategy of tension.

",Bowles: Powell to Undergo Tests on Calf,"Bowles: Powell to Undergo Tests on Calf
(Before It's News)
One of the biggest story lines unrelated to the Jets’ performance on the field yesterday was the news that running back Bilal Powell, who missed the entire second half, will undergo tests on an injured calf that he suffered against the Browns according to head coach Todd Bowles.
With Matt Forte sidelined with turf toe, Powell and rookie running back Elijah McGuire became the top two backs on the depth chart but the Jets weren’t able to get much going on the ground (13 carries for 25 yards) as the Browns consistently loaded the box.
If Powell’s injury is going to cost him time and Forte’s turf toe isn’t healed, the Jets will be looking to add a running back as the only other back on the roster, Travaris Cadet, has just 26 carries in five NFL seasons. Running back/kick returner Marcus Murphy who is currently on the practice squad could be the next man up.
You can discuss this with other NY Jets fans on the Jet Nation message board. Or visit of on Facebook.

",She Was About to Quit Acting. Then She Got the Role of a Lifetime.,"This was less a gush and more a righteous roar of approval, however, with critics cheering that a secret star of British theater — so chameleonic that she’d gone underrecognized for over a decade — had finally smashed into success. The play, which originated at the National Theater, in a coproduction with Headlong, duly transferred to the West End.
Photo
But success came only just in time: If Ms. Gough hadn’t gotten the part, she was going to quit acting altogether. She’d had a year without any work, and was broke.
Over a recent lunch in a West London brasserie where she makes a joke of ostentatiously ordering lobster pasta, she’s able to laugh at how far she’s come. “I can’t believe it,” she said. “It’s completely nuts.”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Ms. Gough (it rhymes with cough), who’s lived in London since she was a teenager, is great company, her chat as quick and flashing as those very blue eyes. She clearly doesn’t suffer fools, and enjoys pricking actorly pretensions. (“I like to shout ‘Macbeth’ a lot.”) Yet beneath the expletive-riddled sarcasm dwells a spiritual belief that the universe is unfolding as it should; she rejected Catholicism, but retains some “faith in a higher power — something very personal to me.”
So when it came to Emma, she had a sense that it was meant to be. “People will laugh, but I feel like the characters find me,” she said. “The ones I’m supposed to play, I’m going to play.”
She still busted a gut to get it, however, even snorting a line of icing sugar when auditioning. “It was one of those mythic auditions,” recalled Mr. Macmillan, whose adaptation of “1984” just closed on Broadway. “This play needs a talent, someone very charismatic. Denise came in and grabbed it by the throat and wrestled it to the floor.”
Why does she think “People, Places & Things” connected so profoundly with audiences? “Do you know someone in your life that has addiction issues?” she threw the question back at me. “So does every single person in this room, yet it’s so shrouded in shame. Duncan tapped into our need to connect with each other about that stuff.”
Jeremy Herrin, the play’s director, acknowledged that “American culture is much more conversant in addiction narratives, with more purchase on self-help and the therapeutic conversation than us repressed Brits,” but contended that the subject is universal. And Ms. Gough’s performance is key. “Denise is so attuned to the subject matter,” Mr. Herrin continued. “She gets it. She’s very brave, very courageous.”
Photo
In rehearsals, where tears flow and vocal cords surely shred, it’s striking how Ms. Gough also frequently refers to time the company spent with addicts in a recovery center in South London.
“To me, it’s incredibly brave for an addict to get clean,” she said. “The most avant-garde thing you can do in the world today is live sober, because if there was ever a time you’d want to switch off all the feelings it’s now, right?”
Audience members would pour their hearts out to her after shows; she still wears a pendant necklace that a recovering addict sent her in gratitude. “It’s more than a play for me,” she explained. And she’s not about to jeopardize it by succumbing to excess herself.

“No, I’ve done it all — I don’t need to,’’ she said. “I am actually such a safe bet now, because my work is really important to me and I don’t want to be [expletive] that up.”

Ms. Gough is becoming a more regular screen presence, recently appearing in “Guerrilla,” John Ridley’s Showtime mini-series about the British black power movement. Next year she plays Keira Knightley’s lover in “Colette,” a film about the French novelist; Ms. Gough is Mathilde de Morny, who dressed in suits and was “one of the first women to identify as a man.”
Her heart belongs to the theater, however. Her first taste was playing Miss Hannigan in a school production of “Annie.” “I made the audience laugh,” she recalled, “and I remember thinking: ‘Yep, that feels nice, I’ll have more of that.’ ”
She grew up in Ennis, Ireland; her father was a head of fisheries, her mother a marriage counselor. She was the seventh of 11 children — which explains her love of applause.

“It is obviously psychological,” she said, “now, what I do for a living, is get attention. But I wasn’t brought up with the thought that acting was a possibility.” Stubbornly determined to prove her parents wrong, she moved to London at just 15, and after a precarious few years living in squats, won a scholarship to the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts.
Her experience has made her an outspoken supporter of immigration as well as government support for those out of work or on low incomes — a fraught subject in Britain.
“I am an immigrant, but the difference between me and the immigrants dying in the sea is that I’m white and English-speaking, and that to me is deeply troubling,” she said. “England saved my life, really. I took advantage of everything this country has to offer, and now I’m giving back.”
She is troubled by contemporary politics in her adopted home country, particularly Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. That, followed by the election of President Donald Trump, left her reeling. Yet “People, Places & Things” has also provided her with a framework for understanding the current turbulent state of the world.
”An addict has to hit rock bottom before they change their lives,’’ she said. ”Maybe the world is hitting rock bottom, and there’s going to be a glorious spiritual awakening where we all start looking after each other.”

Is she optimistic, ultimately? “I have to be otherwise I would top myself,” she answered. “I can’t lose hope. I refuse.”
On the heels of the four-week New York run of “People, Places & Things,” Ms. Gough will reprise the role she played this summer — another addict, the Valium-hooked Harper in Tony Kushner’s “Angels in America.”
But audiences can expect an unusually punchy Harper, not a hazy victim.
“Someone said to me, she’s really angry,” Ms. Gough explained. “Well, wouldn’t you be? Harper has to save herself. That’s why the speech at the end is pure joy. It’s got to be: ‘It’s going to be really hard, but I’m going to be free.’ Free from addiction, free from a husband that doesn’t love me, free to leave.”
Ms. Gough shakes her head. “God, the bravery of women.”",1

","Tennis: Nadal crushes Fognini, Federer joins him in Shanghai quarters","Tennis - Shanghai Masters tennis tournament - Shanghai, China - October 12, 2017 - Rafael Nadal of Spain in action against Fabio Fognini of Italy. REUTERS/Aly Song
(Reuters) - Rafael Nadal continued to scythe his way through the Shanghai Masters on Thursday, reaching the quarter-finals with a 6-3 6-1 thrashing of temperamental Italian Fabio Fognini.
The Spaniard needed two minutes over the hour to dispatch Fognini, taking his winning streak to 14 matches since the start of the U.S. Open where he claimed a 16th grand slam title.
The 31-year-old is closing in on finishing the year as world number one for the first time since 2013 but Roger Federer, the only man who can stop him, is looking equally impressive.
Federer delighted his small army of Chinese fans inside the Qi Zhong Centre with an emphatic 6-4 6-2 defeat of tricky Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov.
Fognini was playing the day after being handed a suspended ban from two grand slams and $96,000 fine for verbally abusing a female umpire at the U.S. Open.
But there was little fight from the 30-year-old as Nadal lost only six points on serve in the opening set.

While a Nadal-Federer final looms, Argentina’s Juan Martin del Potro could ruin the script, as he did at the U.S. Open where he defeated Federer in the quarter-finals when a semi-final between the two greats looked likely.
The former U.S. Open champion stopped third seed Alexander Zverev, recovering from losing the opener to win 3-6 7-6(5) 6-4.
“I think he played a great match, maybe one of the best of the season,” Zverev said.
Sixth seed Grigor Dimitrov, who saved match points on Wednesday against Ryan Harrison, had a more comfortable day as he beat American 10th seed Sam Querrey 6-3 7-6(3).
Bulgarian Dimitrov, who could claim a debut appearance at the ATP World Tour Finals in London next month by reaching the final in Shanghai, plays Nadal next.
Wimbledon runner-up Marin Cilic also eased into the quarter-finals with a 7-6(1) 6-4 defeat of American Steve Johnson.",1

",The Cubs’ Secret to Success? Group Hugs,"Maddon is well-known for trying to keep things light — on Sunday, for instance, he put a buffet on the field at Wrigley as his players practiced — but he is also wholeheartedly behind the friendship circles that were created by Buss.
“He’s so creative,’’ Maddon said. “What he does in the weight room and what he does by having the masses outside, it’s very entertaining and the guys look forward to it. They really do.’’

Buss, who has been the team’s strength and conditioning coordinator since 2001, began the group sessions on the field in August of 2016. The Cubs had the best record in baseball at the time, but Buss said a member of the club was having a tough time. So he gathered his colleagues around him on the field and asked everyone to say something positive.

So it began, and the daily gatherings have continued ever since.
The group sessions on the field are not long — anywhere from five to 10 minutes — but they are full of life and laughter. After each of his teammates spoke in the circle the other day, La Stella offered a hug. First baseman Anthony Rizzo had his arms wrapped around two teammates during Saturday’s gathering. And that day, as Tekchandani entered the circle, he was welcomed with a round of applause.
“It helps a lot,” catcher Willson Contreras said of the bonding. “It keep us together as a family, and happy together, despite being in a pressure-filled situation in the playoffs.”
“It’s like 10 minutes of fun,” Buss said.
Buss, who sports a beer belly and a mohawk, is immensely popular among Cubs players. In spring training, he is famous for the outrageous outfits he wears as he presides over daily conditioning. But there seems to be a method to his madness.
“Even though he’s funny and comes off as a goofball, he’s one of the smartest guys we’ve got in here,” outfielder Albert Almora Jr. said. “If he’s doing something, it’s for a purpose.”
Buss is modest about what impact his feel-good exercises may be having on the team’s fortunes. Feeling good does not guarantee a player will whack a really good curveball for a hit. “I don’t know how much that plays into it,’’ he said of the connection between what he does on the field with the players and what they do when the game begins.
But the players — Buss’s players really — beg to differ. “The more positive things in the clubhouse, the better the results,” Contreras said.
Bryant noted that even though the pregame sessions are a daily phenomenon, those taking part do not run out of things to mention. It is easy, he said, to always find something nice to say about the person standing in the middle of the circle, whether it be about their role as a teammate or friend or co-worker or parent.
“It definitely gets everyone’s confidence up,’’ Russell said. “To hear nice things said about you from guys that are professionals and have been for a long time, it definitely makes you happy.”",1

","Russia, China call for restraint after Trump comment on North Korea","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia and China called for restraint on North Korea on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump warned over the weekend that “only one thing will work” in dealing with Pyongyang, hinting that military action was on his mind.
When asked what Russia made of Trump’s comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters:
“Moscow has called and continues to call on the parties involved in the conflict and on those who have anything to do with this issue to exercise restraint and to avoid any steps that would only worsen the situation.”
Commenting on a Trump statement that the United States might withdraw from a nuclear deal with Iran, Peskov said such a move would have “negative consequences.”
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying reiterated a call for all parties involved with the standoff in North Korea to exercise restraint, describing the situation as extremely complex and serious.
China hopes all sides do nothing to irritate each other or worsen the problem and speak and act cautiously, she told a daily news briefing.
In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, all in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.
Trump repeatedly has made clear his distaste for dialogue with North Korea. Last week, he dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time, a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s government.
“Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars & getting nothing. Policy didn’t work!” the U.S. president said in a Twitter post on Monday.
Trump’s comments seemed to further suggest that military action was on his mind.
On Saturday, Trump made a similar comment on Twitter about how negotiations have failed for 25 years and said “only one thing will work” with North Korea.",1

","Bipartisan Congress Put Jeff Sessions in His Place, Shut Down His Expansion of Civil Asset Forfeiture","By Rachel Blevins
While it is a rare occasion when the group claiming to represent the will of the American people actually votes accordingly, the House of Representatives voted in opposition of Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ plan to expand civil asset forfeiture on Tuesday.
The Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act will now include Amendment 126, which “restricts the use of the federal government’s use of adoptive forfeiture.” It is co-sponsored by a group of nine bipartisan representatives, including Justin Amash, a Republican from Michigan, and Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat from Hawaii.
“About to speak on the House floor in support of my amendment to rein in unconstitutional civil asset forfeiture,” Amash wrote on Twitter. “We must defend our rights.”
About to speak on the House floor in support of my amendment to rein in unconstitutional civil asset forfeiture. We must defend our rights. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) September 12, 2017
Gabbard noted that she co-sponsored the bill because it was “yet another area where AG Sessions must be stopped in his unconstitutional attempts to expand civil asset forfeiture.”
“I’ll be on House floor soon with Justin Amash urging support for our bipartisan amendment to stop AG Sessions expansion of adoptive forfeiture,” Gabbard wrote on Twitter. “Adoptive forfeiture allows state law enforcement to sidestep state laws and use federal law to seize people’s property without conviction or charges. Burden of proving innocence is on the individual, not on law enforcement. Even if innocence proved, the property/cash is often not returned.”
I’ll be on House floor soon w/ @justinamash urging support for our bipartisan amdmt to stop AG Sessions expansion of adoptive forfeiture — Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) September 12, 2017
Burden of proving innocence is on the individual, not on law enforcement. Even if innocence proved, the property/cash is often not returned — Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) September 12, 2017
Defining civil asset forfeiture as “a pernicious practice that throws due process out of the window and allows permanent seizure of assets based on an extraordinarily low evidentiary standard,” FreedomWorks.org noted that Amendment 126 seeks to “prohibit the use of funds authorized by Division C from being used for adoptive seizures, through which state and local agencies can circumvent protective state laws to seek forfeiture of seized assets under federal forfeiture laws.”
Sessions announced a new policy to increase civil asset forfeiture in July, labeling it as a means to “better protect victims of crime and innocent property owners, while streamlining the process to more easily dismantle criminal and terrorist organizations.”
The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad) As any of these law enforcement partners will tell you and as President Trump knows well, civil asset forfeiture is a key tool that helps law enforcement defund organized crime, take back ill-gotten gains, and prevent new crimes from being committed, and it weakens the criminals and the cartels. Even more importantly, it helps return property to the victims of crime. Civil asset forfeiture takes the material support of the criminals and instead makes it the material support of law enforcement, funding priorities like new vehicles, bulletproof vests, opioid overdose reversal kits, and better training. In departments across this country, funds that were once used to take lives are now being used to save lives.
However, as The Free Thought Project has reported extensively, and as the majority of the representatives in the House seem to understand, civil asset forfeiture has only led to more corruption.
In fact, even one of the co-creators of the civil asset forfeiture program in the United States has said he thinks it should be abolished. “Three decades ago I helped create our civil asset forfeiture system; now it is time to end it,” Brad Cates, former director of the U.S. Justice Department’s Asset Forfeiture Office, said in February 2016.
During the Reagan administration I helped establish these programs because I believed they would quickly channel seized criminals’ profits into the fight against organized crime and drug cartels. Yet over time we have created a new bad incentive: policing for profit, out of the reach of the proper legislative budget process.
The purpose of “due process” is to ensure that suspects are given a chance to prove their innocence. However, when police are given the power to confiscate cash, weapons, cars and other possessions, the suspects they are targeting are assumed guilty until proven innocent, and even if their innocence is proven in court, their possessions that were stolen by the state are not always returned.

",Blackhawks Roster Breakdown: Forwards,"Blackhawks Roster Breakdown: Forwards
(Before It's News)
With opening night less than a week away, the Blackhawks are down to some tough decisions with their roster. We talked at length about the options on Tuesday night’s Shoutcast, but there are some real questions. I’m going to break down some of the upcoming roster decisions or at least try to lay them out in a logical manner. This doesn’t mean Joel Quenneville will decide to use the logical method. Lastly, we look at the offense:
Brandon Saad – Jonathan Toews – Richard Panik
This is your first line, and it has been since the day the Blackhawks traded Artemi Panarin for Brandon Saad back in June. We all know what we are going to get from Saad and Jonathan Toews. Richard Panik is a bit more of a wild card. No one believed me when I predicted that Panik could easily replace the 34 points that were sent to Montreal with Andrew Shaw. No only did Panik replace the points, but he eclipsed it. By a decent margin. He played all 82 games, and contributed 22 goals, 22 assists for 44 points. These are all better than Andrew Shaw has ever reached in his career. I don’t expect that Panik will have 22 goals again, but it’s really not all that unreasonable. With Saad on the other wing, Panik will have more room to work. As long as he is in the right place, he will have every opportunity to equal that 44 points. This line is light years better now than it was in April. Expect Jonathan Toews to have a bounceback typical Jonny Toews year, and for Brandon Saad to have a career year. Saad is coming off three straight 50+ point seasons, and this year will be no different. 60 points is not unfathomable.
Alex Debrincat – Nick Schmaltz – Patrick Kane
I know, the Debrincat hater has him not only making the team, but playing in the top 6. If you look at the alternatives, there really aren’t any. Unless they move Nick Schmaltz back to wing, no one else fits the position, and they certainly haven’t been playing Schmaltz at center all preseason only to dump him back at the wing. I think Debrincat will hit the wall in ten games and they will need to re-adjust but, for the moment, it won’t hurt to try this combo out to open the season. Speaking of Nick Schmaltz, this kid has impressed me. He was a pouty little brat, last season, once he was sent to Rockford and it rubbed me the wrong way. Granted he still has that pouty look on his face all the time, but his play has grow leaps and bounds. He was “good” last season, after he came back from Rockford, but this preseason he has been excellent. I would have never placed him at second line center, but that is where he has been the entire preseason. He has not looked out of place either. This makes you wonder what the future holds for new third line $4.55 million center Artem Anisimov. Patrick Kane is; Patrick Kane. I don’t want to say too much or the PC Police will come after me.
Patrick Sharp – Artem Anisimov – Ryan Hartman
If we didn’t expect to have Debrincat or Schmaltz on the second line, we certainly didn’t expect to see Artem Anisimov on the third line. If Debrincat makes the team, I’m fine with Sharp on the third line, and if Debrincat doesn’t, then someone like Wingels or Hayden can slide up. Ryan Hartman is a perfect third line player and will have a solid year once again there. Anisimov is a perfectly fine third line center, but I have my reservations about paying a player $4.55 million for the next 4 years to play on the third line. At some point they have to investigate getting him to waive that no trade clause and clear that cap room. For the near future, he is perfectly fine in the third line role. Even if he can’t win a faceoff to save his life. Circling back to Debrincat, Quenneville toyed with playing him on this third line with Anisimov and Hartman, and I’m not a fan whatsoever. He is not really responsible defensively, yet, and he is not a player that drives possession by himself. He needs to be set up for his chances, by skill players. Anisimov and Hartman are good, but they are good straight line players. They are not going to set Debrincat up with beautiful passes, or dazzling moves. I cannot see this experiment working, and you are not putting him in a position to succeed based on his skillset.
Tommy Wingels – Tanner Kero – Lance Bouma
Tomas Jurco, Jordin Tootoo, John Hayden,Vinnie Hinostroza
This fourth line is a complete mystery. You might as well just throw all the names in a hat and randomly pick them out. What you see above is not what I would select, rather what I think Quenneville and Bowman will decide. Tanner Kero is a fine, responsible fourth line center and should have that position locked down. Tommy Wingels, Lance Bouma and Jordin Tootoo are basically the same player in “small, medium, sort-of-large” sizes. If Quenneville wants to keep one of those three players as a 13th forward for the “grit”, that’s fine by me. Keeping all three is simply preposterous. My honest opinion is that they should keep Wingels and Hayden, waive Bouma or Tootoo, and launch Tomas Jurco into the sun. This is not the year to waste roster spots on players that you mistakenly signed or traded for. The problem with this entire scenario is that the Blackhawks rarely ever admit their mistakes, which means Wingels, Bouma, Tootoo, and Jurco will all make the roster. This leaves Hayden and Hinostroza heading due west to Rockford, even though John Hayden has done everything to make this opening night roster. We are only talking about 6-8 minutes a night for this line, but it is just not the best way to maximize your talent. There I go applying logic again. Please allow me to beat any logic out of my brain with a 2×4.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/04/us/bump-stock-las-vegas-shooting/index.html,Bump stock: The device found on Las Vegas shooter's guns,"(CNN) The gunman in the Las Vegas massacre may have rigged his guns with devices that enable a shooter to fire bullets rapidly, mimicking automatic fire.
Twelve bump-fire stocks were found on firearms recovered from Stephen Paddock's hotel room, said Jill Snyder, the special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' San Francisco field office.
Also known by the brand name Slide Fire, bump-fire stocks, or ""bump stocks,"" modify such rifles as an AR-15 to ""allow it to fire in rapid succession or automatic fire,"" said Sam Rabadi, a retired ATF special agent.
A bump-fire stock is seen on one of the weapons found in the hotel suite from which Stephen Paddock rained bullets on concertgoers below. Photo courtesy of WFTX
How do they work?
The difference between semi-automatic weapons and automatic weapons is what happens when you pull the trigger
On semi-automatic weapons, the trigger must be pulled every time to fire a round, after which the weapon reloads itself. On automatic weapons, once the trigger is pulled and held, the weapon will continue firing until the ammunition is expended or the trigger is released.
Bump-fire stocks are attached to the receiver of the rifle. The stock uses the recoil effect to bounce the rifle off the shooter's shoulder and ""bump"" the trigger back into the trigger finger, thereby firing the weapon repeatedly.
These devices can be purchased online or from a manufacturer, and prices can range from $50 to several hundred dollars each.
""You really don't have to be a professional armorer to do it,"" said James Gagliano, a retired FBI supervisory special agent and CNN law enforcement analyst.
""Individuals that suffer from severe arthritis, partial paralysis, or other conditions that affect their ability to traditionally operate a firearm can now utilize the SSAR-15 and the muscular strength in their entire arm to active the firing mechanism,"" the manufacturer said on its website
Are they legal?
While automatic weapons are tightly regulated in the US, the use of bump-fire stocks in semi-automatic weapons is legal.
Bump-fire stocks allow semi-automatic weapons to simulate automatic fire but ""do not actually alter the firearm to fire automatically, making them legal under current federal law,"" Snyder said.
But some believe bump-fire stocks, while legal, violate the spirit of gun restrictions.
""This is something that works around and circumvents our laws,"" Gagliano told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day."" ""You're not mechanically modifying a weapon, but you're putting an aftermarket product on that allows you to lay down ... suppressive fire.""
Could the law change?
The revelation that Paddock's weapons had such devices attached has caught the attention of some lawmakers.
""That is just a huge loophole that allows you to convert a weapon into something that is like an automatic gun,"" Rep. Dina Titus, a Nevada Democrat, told CNN.
Titus is among several members of Congress who want to restrict bump-fire stocks.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, introduced legislation Wednesday that would ban manufacturing or procession of accessories that accelerate a semi-automatic rifle's rate of fire to that of an automatic weapon.
""Why can't we stop this?"" Feinstein said. ""Why can't we keep a weapon from becoming a military battlefield weapon?""
Automatic weapons are illegal, but devices like bump stocks that modify a gun to fire at fully-automatic rates ARE legal. That makes no sense. We introduced a bill today to close that loophole. https://t.co/YYAJADDovR — Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) October 4, 2017
Twenty-six of her Democratic colleagues are on board, but the measure has no formal Republican support. Several senators said Wednesday they were unfamiliar with what bump stocks are and needed to look into them before weighing in on the legislation.
""We'll get hold of some folks in the industry and find out what they do and we'll look at Dianne's bill and make a decision in due time,"" said Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana.
Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, said he couldn't respond to the legislation until his staffers could show him how the devices work and ""how that affects law.""
The purchase of fully automatic weapons has been restricted in the US since the 1930s.
But bump-fire stocks didn't exist when the National Firearms Act was enacted in 1934 or when the law was amended in 1986 to prohibit the transfer or possession of machine guns by civilians.
""As technology has come through in the last number of years I believe the original authors of the act probably did not envision this kind of accessory being used for modifications of this sort,"" Rabadi said.",1

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis will get closer to the heavens this month when he puts in a call to the International Space Station.
The Vatican said on Monday the pope would make the call at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) on October 26. It gave no further details, but Francis has supported the work of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, which regularly brings together scientists from around the world to exchange views on topics such as climate change.
The current six-member crew of the International Space Station is made up of three Americans, two Russians and one Italian.
It orbits the Earth at a height of about 220 miles, according to NASA’s website.

",All-male panel on feminism comes under fire in Mexico,"TEPIC, Mexico (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A debate about feminism with an all-male panel at Mexico’s biggest university is under fire on social media for its lack of women, although the panel moderator says it was an attempt at portraying men’s roles.
The panel led by feminist and anthropologist Marta Lamas and featuring 11 men discussing feminism, rights and the market has been criticized online as “feminism for dummies” and prompted one participant to drop out.
Set for Oct. 11, the event is entitled “Marta Lamas in Dialogue with XY,” a reference to male chromosomes.
Online, critics called it a case of “mansplaining,” when men condescendingly tell women about topics that they do not need explained.
“Because there’s nobody better to talk about feminism than a man,” said one Twitter user.
“What next?” asked another on Twitter. “A conference of atheists talking about religion? Carnivores talking about veganism? Communists talking about capitalism?”
Lamas said the event was misinterpreted and meant as homage to her work on her 70th birthday while recognizing the role of men in improving the position of women.
“Since I’ve been having conferences and meetings with women for about 48 years, I said, ‘Well, it’s really something fresh and different,'” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
“The idea to put ‘XY’ instead of men was sense of humor,” she added. “It was a wink of the eye.”
Lamas said she had not chosen the panelists for the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) event and was taken aback by the vehement reaction on social media.
One panelist, journalist Jenaro Villamil, said on Twitter he was pulling out. “I‘m not interested in continuing this game of hate,” he wrote.
Feminism can be a controversial topic in Mexico, where machismo is strong and violence against women is common. Roughly 650 women were murdered in Mexico in the first six months of this year, according to the National Citizen Observatory, a civil group that monitors justice and security.
Feminist activist Veronica Vidal Degiorgis said outcry over the panel showed differences over whether to involve men in talk of improving the lives of women.
“If something good comes out of this, it’s how we can have more engagement on moving the agenda forward,” Degiorgis told the Foundation. “(Men) also have the right to be involved in some point in how to dismantle the patriarchy, as they’re part of it.”",1

","Highlighting Vietnam War's relevance, exhibit opens in New York","An exhibit about the Vietnam War is seen at the New York Historical Society in New York City, U.S. October 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When the idea for a Vietnam War exhibit came up at the New-York Historical Society a few years ago, Trustee James Grant recalls that even after more than four decades, passions about it were strong.
“I got into a lively discussion with another member of the executive committee about America’s motive and about the nature of the struggle and whether it was all for naught or not,” said Grant, a Navy veteran who served off Vietnam in 1965 and 1966.
The war, which divided the United States and exposed the limits of its military might, is the subject of a new exhibit that resonates with today’s divisive politics.
Nearly three years in the making, “The Vietnam War: 1945-1975” opens on Wednesday at the 200-year-old institution. The interactive exhibit has relevance to current times, said its curator, Marci Reaven.
“It may be that much of the political polarization since then may in fact derive from the conflicts that arose among Americans around the war,” said Reaven.
Through artifacts, video, audio and photographs, the exhibit tells the story of the conflict from its post-World War Two origins when the United States backed French troops trying to retain colonial rule over Indochina.
It depicts the escalation and de-escalation, as it was called at the time, of American troop numbers in Vietnam and the growing anti-war movement at home, as well as demonstrations supporting the war effort.

The exhibit tells the story of the war from both sides. It includes a 1962 North Vietnamese propaganda engraving in lacquer, which the still-living artist, who later fought in the war, recreated exclusively for the historical society.
It also includes a Bullpup missile from an F-105 fighter-bomber, a Jeep, and two 24-foot long artistic renderings of a 1966-67 timeline that visitors can touch to get video clips of moments in history.
There is also a draft card, which every 18- to 26-year-old male was required to carry at the time, and which many young men burned in public displays of defiance. The draft, which made the war all the more real for millions of would-be conscripts, ended in 1973, shortly after the last American troops left Vietnam.

When it was over, the war had cost 58,315 U.S. servicemen their lives, the United States had dumped more explosive tonnage on Southeast Asia than it dropped during World War Two, and South Vietnam was overrun by the communist North in 1975.
If the exhibit sounds a little like the 10-part documentary by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick that just aired on public television, it is only partly a coincidence. Researchers on the two projects worked independently, except for the sharing of some archival film footage but agreed to coordinate the launch of their works, Reaven said.
Historical society visitors will be invited to write or record their thoughts for posterity.
“We’d like them to experience, as we did, the idea that wars are a product of many decisions that are made by governments and individuals and it’s important to look at those decisions, to pay attention to these decisions when they’re being made,” said Reaven.
The society will host the exhibit through April 22.

",Lewis Hamilton on title race and possibility of winning in Austin,"Lewis Hamilton's win was the fourth of his career in Japan
Lewis Hamilton says he is taking nothing for granted in the title race despite opening a huge lead with victory in the Japanese Grand Prix.
The Mercedes driver leads Sebastian Vettel by 59 points after his Ferrari rival retired early in Suzuka.
""I just have to keep my head down and keep doing what I've been doing,"" Hamilton said. ""There are still 100 points available.
""We've still got to win the next four races.""
Hamilton has taken four wins and a second place in the five races since Formula 1 returned from its summer break at the Belgian Grand Prix at the end of August.
By contrast, Vettel's bid has imploded, with a start-line crash in Singapore followed by engine issues affecting his races in Malaysia and Japan.
Hamilton will clinch the title if he wins the next race, the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, and Vettel is lower than fourth.
Hamilton said: ""Is it a purple patch? A golden patch maybe. It's definitely been a great second half of the season. An incredible performance from the team.""
Lewis Hamilton celebrated with the Mobot as Olympian Sir Mo Farah looked on
Hamilton said his advantage was ""kind of unbelievable, really"", adding: ""I could only have dreamed of having this kind of gap. Ferrari have put on such a great challenge all season long. My team have done a great job. They are so meticulous and that is why we have the reliability we are having.""
Vettel suffered a problem with a spark plug which cost him power and the team retired his car after four laps.
The problem comes a week after he started from the back of the grid in Malaysia after a failure in a manifold in the engine in qualifying, an issue which also caused team-mate Kimi Raikkonen's retirement before the race started the next day.
Vettel admitted that winning the championship would now be difficult.
""Of course,"" he said. ""I don't have to be a mathematician. What we have to do now, and I said also to the guys: 'Let's get back, get some rest. It has been tough weeks with a lot of changes.
""The mechanics are tired, the team is tired. It is good to get some rest and then we know we have the package to do well in the last four races. That's what we focus to do and the rest we'll see.""
Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said: ""This is a sport where you take no prisoners and reliability is part of making it to the end and we have been there in the last few years.
""We just need to collect the points but I can relate to how it feels for Ferrari and it is certainly not very nice.
""It is not over until it's over. We have seen with Sebastian's misfortune how quickly you can lose points. It is all about finishing the races.
""There are 100 points left. We just need to look one race weekend after the other and score. Austin can be a solid step towards the championship but we won't be counting our chickens until it's done.""",1

","N.F.L. Picks: Lions Over Panthers, and Steelers Over Jaguars","Among the surprising statistics in Hunt’s breakout season is the amount of space he creates before he is touched. He has averaged 4.15 yards before contact, according to Sportradar, which not only makes him first in the N.F.L., but the figure is also more than double the leaguewide average (1.94) over the last three seasons. His average has been aided tremendously by 69- and 58-yard touchdown runs in which he was not touched, but he has exceeded the league average in that statistic on 34 of his 68 carries, with 14 runs in which he went 6 or more yards before contact. And he has done most of that behind a banged-up offensive line playing without its starting center, Mitch Morse.
Houston tends to surprise in big moments, and Hunt is bound to cool off at some point. But, at least this week, the only undefeated team left in the N.F.L. is likely to stay that way.
Pick: Chiefs
Panthers at Lions 1 p.m., Fox
Line: Lions by 2 ½
Cam Newton should have spent the week talking about how he and the Panthers (3-1) had their way with the New England Patriots in Week 4, but his decision to mock a female reporter at a news conference created yet another distraction for the player and the team. How the emotional Newton will react to this self-imposed turmoil is unknown, but the situation came just as he finally looked healthy, throwing and running with confidence against New England.
The Lions (3-1) should pose an interesting test. They can put up points in a hurry, but can also frustrate opposing quarterbacks. Detroit’s lone loss came in a nail-biter against the Atlanta Falcons, with the team falling inches short of victory on a catch in the closing seconds. The talent is there for both teams to shine, but with the game in Detroit, the edge goes to the Lions. Pick: Lions
Packers at Cowboys 4:25 p.m., Fox
Line: Cowboys by 2
The revamped Green Bay secondary has gotten only one real test, which came in Week 2 against Atlanta. The test did not go well, leading to the Packers’ lone loss of the season. Wins against Cincinnati and Chicago are nice, of course, but they do not give much indication of what the Packers (3-1) can do against a balanced team like Dallas.
In a Week 4 loss to Los Angeles, the Cowboys (2-2) picked up where they left off in the second half of their Week 3 win over Arizona, scoring touchdowns on three consecutive drives. The second half was a different story, as the Rams tightened and Dallas’s offense disappeared. Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott are talented enough to bounce back and put up points against Green Bay, but short of DeMarcus Lawrence, the Cowboys have relatively few defensive players who can intimidate Aaron Rodgers and the Packers’ offense.
Pick: Packers
Seahawks at Rams 4:05 p.m., CBS
Line: Rams by 1 ½
The Rams (3-1) have established a cohesive offensive strategy: Give the ball to Todd Gurley as often as possible. The third-year running back is averaging career highs in carries per game, rushing yards per game, receptions per game and receiving yards per game, and he leads Los Angeles in each of those categories. The bruising runner even showed off his receiving skills last week. Jared Goff saw him streaking down the middle of the field to take advantage of a safety’s having cheated toward the line of scrimmage and hit him for a sensational 53-yard catch-and-run. With all of the attention on Gurley, both as a runner and a receiver, Goff has time to find opportunities for Cooper Kupp and Sammy Watkins.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Whether that offensive strategy can work against the Seahawks (2-2) is an open question, but Seattle certainly seems vulnerable despite a blowout win over the woeful Indianapolis Colts last week. Before that victory, Seattle had gone 1-2, with the win coming against the rebuilding San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks have allowed an ugly 134 yards a game on the ground, and that softness up front should be enticing for Gurley.
If the Rams’ Wade Phillips-designed defense can play the way it did in the second half last week against Dallas, Los Angeles can take a commanding division lead. Pick: Rams

Jaguars at Steelers 1 p.m., CBS
Line: Steelers by 8
The Jaguars (2-2) have been maddeningly inconsistent, but a pattern has emerged in the form of having the best pass defense and the worst run defense in the N.F.L. The Steelers’ Ben Roethlisberger is struggling to produce in the passing game, but conveniently for Pittsburgh (3-1), running back Le’Veon Bell appears to have shaken off a preseason slump. Add all of that up and Pittsburgh is likely to run the ball early and often against Jacksonville’s soft front seven, with Bell using his patience and speed to exploit any and all weaknesses. Pick: Steelers
Cardinals at Eagles 1 p.m., Fox
Line: Eagles by 6 ½
Even without Fletcher Cox (calf injury), the Eagles (3-1) should be able to put plenty of pressure on Carson Palmer. When that happens, it can lead to bad things for the Cardinals (2-2), as Palmer has been turning the ball over way too much. When the Eagles have the ball, they will have to contend with Arizona’s opportunistic secondary. That could frustrate Carson Wentz, but with this game in Philadelphia, and with Arizona’s wins this season against Indianapolis and San Francisco, there is little reason to expect an upset.

Bills at Bengals 1 p.m., CBS
Line: Bengals by 3
To the delight of Buffalo’s loyal fan base, the Bills (3-1) have rolled to a fast start. They were considered basement dwellers entering the season, but their record cannot be explained away as facing bad opponents, as two of their wins came against Denver and Atlanta. Their defense might actually be as good as it has looked thus far, but there is reason to believe Buffalo has played over its head, while the Bengals (1-3) have underperformed. Pick: Bengals
Ravens at Raiders 4:05 p.m., CBS
Line: Raiders by 2 ½
Two weeks ago, the Raiders (2-2) looked incredible, and were off to the franchise’s first 2-0 start since 2002. But with Derek Carr sustaining a fracture in his back last week and Marshawn Lynch’s comeback tour running out of momentum, Oakland fans can be forgiven for letting some pessimism creep in. Oakland’s status as a contender is almost entirely dependent on how quickly and how well Carr can come back from his injury, but a win at home over the Ravens (2-2) seems possible even with E. J. Manuel replacing him. The Raiders’ situation certainly feels like one that Al Davis, the team’s longtime owner, would have tried to fix by signing Colin Kaepernick. Pick: Raiders
Titans at Dolphins 1 p.m., CBS
Line: N/A
The Dolphins (1-2) are averaging 8.5 points a game. They have only two touchdowns in three games and appear to be in total disarray. Their best chance for a win has less to do with their quarterback, Jay Cutler, than it does with whoever is playing quarterback for the Titans (2-2). Marcus Mariota will almost assuredly tear Miami apart if he is healthy enough to play, but if the Titans are forced to turn to Matt Cassel, the game, which is Miami’s home opener, could be considerably closer. Pick: Titans

Jets at Browns 1 p.m., Fox
Line: Browns by 1
The Jets (2-2) are on a two-game winning streak, but they are slight underdogs against a winless team. While neither team can claim to be ready for prime time (even 1 p.m. may be too late in the day), Cleveland will at least get a boost from the debut of Myles Garrett, the defensive end drafted No. 1 over all by the Browns (0-4) this year. Combine that with the Jets having two fluky wins in a row and it feels as if it is Cleveland’s turn to harm its 2018 draft position with a win. Pick: Browns
49ers at Colts 1 p.m., Fox
Line: Colts by 1 ½
Frank Gore is San Francisco’s career leader in rushing yards, but for the first time, he will be facing the 49ers (0-4) as a member of the Colts (1-3). Gore may no longer be the same player he once was — his average of 47.8 rushing yards a game is his lowest mark since his rookie season — but with 4 yards he will pass Eric Dickerson for seventh on the career rushing list. Every player ahead of Gore on the list is a Hall of Famer, as are six of the seven players below him. Pick: Colts
Chargers at Giants 1 p.m., CBS
Line: Giants by 3 ½
No team wants to be winless after four weeks, and playoff hopes for the Chargers (0-4) and the Giants (0-4) are likely all but abandoned. A closer look, though, reveals Los Angeles has lost by 3 or fewer points in three of four games and the Giants have done the same thing twice. With a little more luck — especially in the kicking game for the Chargers — either team could be 2-2 or 3-1. That being said, both teams have been dreadful on offense, and this game could be ugly. Pick: Giants",1

","Singer-Songwriter and Pianist, Shauna Burns, Announces New Release: “Scarborough Fair,” Coming 10/6/17!","Singer-Songwriter and Pianist, Shauna Burns, Announces New Release: “Scarborough Fair,” Coming 10/6/17!
(Before It's News)
Shauna Burns, the seasoned Celtic inspired artist, is known for enchanting listeners with her soothing vocals, sweeping piano solos, and spiritually healing music.
Salt Lake City, UT, Sep 29, 2017 - Shauna Burns, the seasoned Celtic inspired artist, is known for enchanting listeners with her soothing vocals, sweeping piano solos, and spiritually healing music. The singer-songwriter and pianist is set to release her cover single of an old-time classic, “Scarborough Fair,” on October 6, 2017 through the label Red Rock Music.
Shauna Burns rejuvenates “Scarborough Fair” with her own Celtic spin to this English traditional ballad. Singing the female’s reply to the male’s request to prove true love, Shauna brings her own perspective to this classic tale. Her intricate yet, delicate piano melodies whisk through the entire piece. Shauna’s crystalline and haunting vocal performance is laced between engaging threads and a Celtic harp that broaden the dreamy effect of the song.
“I had been spending a lot of time in green lush places lately and I started to imagine the woman in this song walking through the landscape, says Shauna Burns. I heard her voice so clearly and I went to the piano and started to tinker out the first bit of the song.”
“Scarborough Fair” highlights the tale of a young man who instructs the listener to tell his past lover to complete a series of impossible tasks, in order for him to take her back. Typically the song is performed as a duet, with the women ordering the man to perform equally impossible tasks, as well. In the brand new version, Shauna sings “ask him to find me an acre of land, between the salt water and the sea-sand.”
Shauna continues, “I imagine this couple is probably having a bump in their relationship and are trying to get each other to do the impossible task to win back their love… but I sensed at the end both of them want to forgive, want to move forward, but perhaps their pride is in the way? I felt when I was recording “Scarborough Fair” that ‘her’ soft vocals maybe gave the game away… maybe just a touch. I personally think true love prevails at the end.”
The piano, keyboard, vocals and musical arrangements were done by Shauna Burns. Caroline Kemper ReidReynoso performed on the Celtic harp, and Dee Kei Waddell on the double bass and keyboard. The song was produced by Shauna Burns and James Clark, and was engineered/mastered/co-produced by Dee Kei Waddell.
About Shauna Burns:
Burns had developed her captivating vocal and playing style while growing up in Miami, Florida where she was inspired by her mother’s love for the piano and groundbreaking pop/rock artists like Sarah McLachlan and Tori Amos. After releasing four studio albums and countless singles, Burns has hit FMQB AC Charts, was one of WCH Radio’s “Top Songs of the Year” and hit #1 on “Song Vault Radio.” The Moon and the Fire Circle album was selected as “Best of 2008” by Collected Sounds and The Promise Live. Shauna Burns continues to capture audiences across the globe with her heartwarming music. Her profound lyrics and piano driven sound has built her reputation in the Celtic music world and has also allowed her to tour extensively through the U.S. and U.K. For more information please visit: http://shaunaburns.com/music/

",India may allow female haj pilgrims to travel without male guardian,"MUMBAI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Indian women over the age of 45 and traveling in groups of four will be able to go for the Islamic haj pilgrimage without a male guardian next year, if the government adopts proposed reforms.
Women meeting these criteria will no longer have to be accompanied by a mahram, or close male relative, such as a father, husband, brother or son, a government-appointment panel recommended in the country’s first haj policy review.
“The mahram rule was there from the very beginning for women - in case they face any difficulty while traveling, it can be taken care of,” said Maqsood Ahmed Khan of the Haj Committee of India, a government body which organizes the pilgrimages.
”This (dropping of male kin) is an important recommendation, the chief executive told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Nearly half of an estimated 170,000 pilgrims who went for the annual religious celebration in Saudi Arabia from India this year were women, officials said.
The panel of bureaucrats and intellectuals was appointed by the ministry of minority affairs to review India’s haj policy for the first time.
Officials from the ministry, which will decide whether to adopt the recommendations, were not available for comment.
The policy would cover the next five years from 2018 and is in line with Saudi Arabia’s haj requirements.
Women’s rights campaigners welcomed the proposal but said it did not go far enough.
“Muslim women are traveling across the world independently,” said Noorjehan Safia Niaz, founder of Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, which campaigns for Muslim women’s rights and won a ban on an instant divorce law in August..
“While this is a good decision, the restrictions on age and group size should go.”
If the new rule is implemented, solo women will no longer have to pay private tour operators to provide them with a mahram for a fee of 10,000 Indian rupees ($153.29), campaigners said.",1

",A Staten Island Sensation,"People have been talking for quite a while now about how good the Yankees farm system is.
Photo: MLB.com
We hear a lot about certain prospects… you know, what’s going on with them and how they’re doing. It’s great. But what we don’t hear too much is the individual teams and how they’re doing. I mean sure, you might catch a snippet of Michael Kay talking about them during a game, but they’re usually vague and short descriptions. Unless you live close to one of the teams, there really isn’t much coverage of the team’s and games, especially at the lower levels of the system. And so, I spoke with Casey about it, and with the minor league seasons being completed, I have decided to do a series about the individual teams, from Class-A SS to AAA. With that being said, let’s get started with the Class-A SS Staten Island Yankees of the New York-Penn League. I hope you enjoy this!
Look, overall the Staten Island Yankees had a good season. Led by manager Julio Mosquera , they finished their season with a record of 46-29, winning the New York-Penn League’s McNamara division. In fact, with a .613 winning percentage, they had the best record in the league. Unfortunately, they were knocked from the playoffs in the semifinals by the Hudson Valley Renegades. The Renegades became champs.

During the season, Staten Island had a few guys step up and surprise us. One of the best stories was Jorge Guzman , a pitcher acquired in the Brian McCann trade and has emerged as the staff ace. For a better perspective on Guzman and the 2017 Staten Island Yankees, check out this nugget from Pinstriped Prospects
Photo: Pinstriped Prospects-Robert M. Pimpsner)
“Guzman finished the season with a 5-3 record, 2.30 ERA, and a 1.04 WHIP in 13 starts. Over that span he threw 66 2/3 innings where he gave up 17 earned runs, 18 walks, and struck out a league-high 88. Guzman consistently threw his fastball in triple-digits (hitting a season-high 102.7 mph velocity), while also showcasing a low-90s change-up and a knee-buckling curveball that averaged 86 mph. What was probably most impressive about this 21-year-old from the Dominican Republic though was his stamina and demeanor on the mound. Guzman’s fastball rarely lost a tick in the later innings of his starts, and he usually found a way to pitch himself out of trouble and avoid “the big inning.” It will be interesting to see what level the Yankees decide to start him next season.”
Personally, I’m excited about Guzman, and I really love to keep up with minor league system. I sometimes wish I lived closer to one of these teams so I could be able to cover the games for BYB and share my own perspective. For now, I wanted to share something about this kid… he’s something special.
More soon…

(Before It's News)

By Hanna Heller
Unlike the fake news reports that had rumored everything from divorce to financial ruin for Chip and Joanna Gaines, this time, the end for “Fixer Upper” is real.
“Fixer Upper”, an HGTV show in which the stars find fixer-uppers for prospective buyers and then fix them up, has been a phenomenal success for the network and starring couple, but Chip and Joanna announced Wednesday that season five will be their last.
“It is with both sadness and expectation that we share the news that season 5 of Fixer Upper will be our last,” the TV couple posted to their blog. “While we are confident that this is the right choice for us, it has for sure not been an easy one to come to terms with.”
The stars indicated that they were leaving the show to rest, refocus, and spend time with their family.
“This has nothing to do with a fraudulent skincare line or anything else you’ll inevitably read,” they posted. “This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment. Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.”
Chip and Joanna said that the fifth and final season would be a grand finale because they “didn’t hold anything back.”
HGTV issued a statement wishing the couple well and promoting the final season as “the best season ever.”
“It takes a huge amount of time and creative energy to make a phenomenal series like ‘Fixer Upper.’ We understand their decision to spend more time with their family. Like all of their fans, we want only the best for them and they know they will always have a home at HGTV.
”Fans can expect that the upcoming season of ‘Fixer Upper’ will be the best season ever and we can’t wait for it to hit the air later this year.“

",Review: Shakespeare Meets Elevator Repair Service. Mayhem Ensues.,"Mr. Collins and company have indeed sent in cousins of those clowns to wreak havoc on Shakespeare’s dark comic drama of judgment, mercy and sexual hypocrisy. Sometimes these demolition experts are pretty funny. But if you don’t already know “Measure for Measure” — and it’s an uncommonly hard play to know — you’ll need NoDoz to stay engaged.
Frustration and even defeat are not unusual responses to “Measure for Measure,” which is set in a medieval, vice-ridden Vienna in which fornication before marriage is punishable by death. That law has gone long unenforced when the play begins, so the enigmatic Duke of Vienna (Scott Shepherd) decides to step aside and put the merciless puritan Angelo (Pete Simpson) in charge.
But even as he sends police into the city’s bars and brothels, Angelo is wrestling with illicit desires of his own. He finds himself inconveniently in lust with Isabella (Rinne Groff), a convent novitiate, when she comes to plead for the life of her brother, Claudio (Greig Sargeant), condemned for premarital sex. All the while, the Duke, disguised as a lowly friar, observes from the shadows.
The scholar Harold Bloom has described “Measure for Measure” as a nihilistic “comedy that destroys comedy.” It is a work that combines psychosexual portraiture that anticipates Freud with stock farcical figures like the illiterate cop and various rascally lowlifes. It does not have a single sympathetic character, and every philosophical principle seems to be contradicted by another.

I usually lower my expectations for “Measure,” which contemporary directors like to trick out in (yawn) S&M and Storm Trooper regalia. The most persuasive version I’ve ever seen, from Fiasco Theater in 2014, refrained from interpretive gloss, and let the play’s paradoxes speak eloquently for themselves. But even in over-conceptualized versions, there’s usually at least one, thought-provoking portrayal that illuminates.
Mr. Collins’s production does feature one such performance, from Mr. Shepherd (more on whom later). Mostly, though, it translates the challenges of a notorious problem play into “oh, why not?” parlor tricks and slapstick.
Much of the intermissionless, two-hours-plus show is conducted at a rushing tempo that defies comprehension. Often, the words being spoken are simultaneously seen (via Eva von Schweinitz’s projections) sliding down the walls of Jim Findlay’s multi-table set, which suggests the shabby boardroom of an underfinanced company.

The performers, wearing Kaye Voyce’s jauntily eclectic costumes, alternately sit, like extras on a movie set, or rush around in high frenzy, scattering papers and props. (I half expected them to start singing, “You say tragedy, I say comedy,” concluding with, “Let’s call the whole thing off.”) And then a silence falls for the Act Three scene in which Isabella explains to Claudio why she cannot sacrifice her maidenhood (to Angelo) to save him from the executioner’s block.

Ms. Groff’s Isabella, dressed to resemble a Tennessee Williams spinster, and Mr. Sargeant’s Claudio speak their exchange plainly and slowly. And it suddenly registers that within all the pious bureaucratic double-talk we’ve been hearing lie matters of genuine life and death. It is an ingeniously placed revelation, and it registers intellectually, if not emotionally.
The lack of affect has to do with the absence of any character definition beyond the archetypal. While I enjoyed the vaudeville neuroses of Mr. Simpson’s Angelo, only one actor told me anything new about “Measure for Measure.”
That’s Mr. Shepherd, whose narrator in “Gatz” was one of the great virtuosic performance of recent years. Here he portrays the “fantastical duke of dark corners” as an exuberant escapee from the House of Windsor, an inbred composite of all the 20th century princes of Wales, including Charles.
This Duke has the enthusiastic but distractible air of a nobleman who has been conditioned to see the world as his personal Erector Set. While his character’s erratic behavior has inspired centuries of debate, Mr. Shepherd suggests that the most accurate interpretation is the simplest.
The Duke acts as he does because he can. He’s the Duke! Like the spoiled and glamorous aristocrats of “The Great Gatsby,” he careers through the lives of lesser mortals, without explanation, leaving others to clean up his mess.
Come to think of it, this feckless man who would be God might have directed the arbitrary production in which he appears.",1

",White House Makes Hard-Line Demands for Any ‘Dreamers’ Deal,"The demands were developed by a half-dozen agencies and departments, officials said. But among the officials behind the demands are Stephen Miller, the president’s top policy adviser, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, both of whom have long advocated extremely aggressive efforts to prevent illegal entry into the country and crack down on undocumented immigrants already here.
The demands represented a concerted effort to broaden the expected congressional debate about the Dreamers to one about overhauling the entire American immigration system — on terms that hard-line conservatives have been pursuing for decades.
In a letter to lawmakers, Mr. Trump said his demands would address “dangerous loopholes, outdated laws and easily exploited vulnerabilities” in the immigration system, asserting that they were “reforms that must be included” in any deal to address the Dreamers.
Democratic leaders in Congress reacted with alarm, saying the demands threaten to undermine the president’s own statements in which he had pledged to work across the aisle to protect the Dreamers through legislation.
Video
“The administration can’t be serious about compromise or helping the Dreamers if they begin with a list that is anathema to the Dreamers, to the immigrant community and to the vast majority of Americans,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leaders in the Senate and the House, said in a joint statement.
Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi, who declared after a White House dinner last month that they had reached a deal with Mr. Trump to protect Dreamers, denounced the president’s demands as failing to “represent any attempt at compromise.” They called it little more than a thinly veiled effort to scuttle negotiations even before they begin in earnest.
“If the president was serious about protecting the Dreamers, his staff has not made a good-faith effort to do so,” they added.

Last month, the president abruptly ended an Obama-era policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, in which former President Barack Obama had used his executive authority to protect about 800,000 of the young immigrants from the threat of deportation and provide them work permits.
Even as Mr. Trump kept his campaign promise to halt what he had described as “one of the most unconstitutional actions ever undertaken by a president,” he quickly added that he would work with Democrats in Congress to replace the executive policy with legislation, giving them six months to do so. But a White House official said on Sunday that Mr. Trump was not open to a deal that would eventually allow the Dreamers to become United States citizens.
“The president’s position has been that he’s called on Congress to come up with a permanent solution and a fix to this process,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said last week.
Immigration advocates will most likely urge Democratic leaders to refuse a deal that includes the president’s proposals. But immigration and human rights advocates are also under pressure to do something for the Dreamers, thousands of whom will begin, by March, losing permission to work and protection from deportation if a deal is not reached.
Privately, many advocates have acknowledged that a negotiated deal with the Republican president is likely to include some immigration changes.
Administration officials responsible for securing the border and enforcing the nation’s immigration laws told reporters on Sunday night that the changes requested by the president were essential to protecting American workers from unfair competition and deterring what they described as a never-ending flow of illegal immigrants into the country.
On the president’s wish list is a long-sought Republican goal of stopping American residents from sponsoring the arrival of extended family members. His demand would limit residents to bringing only spouses and children.

Also central to the effort, officials said, are legal changes that would strip away the rights of illegal immigrants to claim asylum or make another case to stay in the United States, allowing federal officials to more quickly deport them.

“We cannot have true border security if we don’t change federal laws to ensure that people who are apprehended are removed,” said Ron Vitiello, the acting deputy commissioner for Customs and Border Protection.
Thomas D. Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said a vast increase in the number of agents and other federal resources would allow for a crackdown on immigration violators that had been difficult in the past.
Another key part of that crackdown would be on tens of thousands of children who have surged across the border with Mexico during the past several years, many of them seeking to escape gang-related violence in Central American countries. This year, about 38,500 children have been apprehended at the border without their parents.
Administration officials say the children — many of whom are sent to live with a cousin, aunt, uncle or sibling in the United States — must be turned back or quickly deported once they arrive. Under current law, many of them remain in the United States for years during legal proceedings to evaluate their asylum or refugee claims.
If the children are not deported quickly, officials say, many will never leave, eventually becoming a new population of sympathetic young immigrants who seek amnesty. That could create lasting cycles in which illegal immigrants demand to be given a legal status, the officials say.
The president’s demands include new rules that say children are not considered “unaccompanied” at the border if they have a parent or guardian in the United States. They also propose treating children from Central America the same way they do children from Mexico, who can be repatriated more quickly, with fewer rights to hearings.
Mr. Trump is also calling for a surge in resources to pay for 370 additional immigration judges, 1,000 government lawyers and more detention space so that children arriving at the border can be held, processed and quickly returned if they do not qualify to stay longer.
Critics say the focus on deporting unaccompanied children is heartless and impractical. They say many were sent by their parents on long, dangerous treks in the hopes of avoiding poverty, hunger, abuse or death by gangs in their home countries.
Advocates acknowledge that more resources are necessary to speed up those hearings. But they argue that White House efforts to demand quick decisions are likely to merely result in many children being sent back to places where they are raped, beaten or killed.

Sending the children back with just a cursory hearing is “a recipe for disaster in terms of returning people to danger,” said Wendy Young, the president of Kids in Need of Defense, a group that aids young refugees.",1
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-transition/in-brexit-poker-clock-narrows-transition-options-idUSKBN1CG2O2
","In Brexit poker, clock narrows transition options","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Nerves are fraying in the Brexit talks, negotiators are trying to work out if the other side is bluffing about walking away, and a ticking clock is fast narrowing British options come March 2019.
Philip Hammond, Britain’s finance minister, echoed recent EU assertions when he said that a transition period to some new relationship was a “wasting asset”, the value of which would “diminish significantly” for both sides if its form remains unclear to businesses much after the start of the new year.
As negotiators in Brussels make little progress before Prime Minister Theresa May meets EU leaders next week, a warning about a breakdown in talks from a minister seen strongly to favor a business-friendly “bespoke” transition out of the EU came a day after the EU summit chair spoke of a similar new year deadline.
Donald Tusk said on Tuesday that if London fails to settle divorce terms by December, and so unlock talks on the transition and future trade pact, then the EU would reconsider its objectives. That reflects mounting doubts across Europe that any legal exit deal can be struck.
The longer the stand-off goes on, EU negotiators said, the more Britain’s choice come March 30, 2019, will be between the “hard Brexit” by which it will simply quit all EU systems and be treated like, say, Australia, and a virtual status quo, staying in most EU systems, without voting rights, rather like Norway.
“The closer we get, the less there is to discuss about a transition and the more it just goes to a standstill transition, with Britain still in everything, but without a vote,” one said.
“Pretty soon,” said another, “It will be Norway or nothing.”
While all such commentary reflects the sides’ jockeying for negotiating advantage, the evidence this week is that they remain far apart and are getting tetchy. May and the EU traded jabs over whose court “the ball” is in after the prime minister made concessions in a speech at Florence on Sept. 22.
Behind closed doors, British negotiators voiced outraged surprise that her offer was seen as insufficient to launch talks on the future relationship. “It’s hard to say it was genuine,” one EU official said of the show of emotion. “It’s a form of pressure.”
Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier are due to give a news conference around noon (1000 GMT) on Thursday to give an update on the week’s progress.

BUSINESS WORRIES
Businesses are sounding the alarm. A German industry federation warned members to start preparing for a “very hard Brexit”. A senior representative of London’s financial services industry told a Brussels audience this week that a legal transition agreement must be reached by the end of this year.
“Most importantly, it must reflect the status quo,” said Catherine McGuinness of the City of London Corporation. “There is no feasibility in asking firms to transition to a transition. If uncertainty continues, businesses will vote with their feet.”
Hammond ruled out budgeting -- yet -- for more customs and border facilities, and few on the continent believe threats of a walkout they say would hurt Britain more than them.
So leaders will watch May’s struggle to unite her government and sit tight. One senior EU diplomat said British counterparts were in such a weak position that “sometimes I feel sorry them”.
For many in Brussels, that makes a virtual status quo after Brexit the increasingly likely outcome: “In March 2019, Britain will formally leave,” said another EU official.
“But de facto most of the existing arrangements will remain ... They will have their celebration of ‘independence’ and then we will sit down to talking business again.”
May insists a two-year transition period is enough to agree a new free trade pact, but many question that.
John Bruton, the former prime minister of Ireland, has recommended an alternative to either no deal at all or a virtual status quo transition -- just keeping Britain fully in the EU for four years beyond 2019.
Arguing that the two-year deadline set by Article 50 of the EU treaty raises the risk of talks collapsing, and that agreeing first a transition and then another accord is complex, Bruton said this week that Britain and the EU should agree to a six-year negotiating period, with Britain only leaving in 2023.
Neither wants any extension. But Bruton warned: “The present tight time frame ... increases the likelihood of miscalculation and of the UK leaving the EU with no deal at all.”",1

What’s been an up and down season for the Miami Dolphins just got a whole lot more down.
A NSFW video popped up late on Sunday evening, the same day the Fins were 16-10 winners to get to 2-2 on the season after topping the Tennessee Titans 16-10, of one of their coaches allegedly snorting lines of a substance believed to be cocaine before a team meeting.
That coach is offensive line coach Chris Foerster, and the video was originally put out on Reddit, and quickly was shared all over the place until it had to be addressed by the team via a quote.
#Dolphins, on a NSFW online video featuring OL coach Chris Foerster: “We were just made aware of the video & have no comment at this time.” — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 9, 2017
If you haven’t seen the video as of yet, you can clearly see the person snorting something with a bill as he talks to the camera.
Again, very disturbing and there’s a lot of unanswered questions to this latest saga in the NFL and with the Dolphins.

It’s no surprise to see liberal documentarian Michael Moore at the forefront of the latest gun debate; Moore achieved his greatest commercial success with a movie called “Bowling for Columbine” that addressed the topic of American gun violence and he has been a staunch and persistent enemy of the Second Amendment for most of his career. This, however, may be the first time that Moore has proposed repealing the Second Amendment and replacing it with one of his own device. Ladies and gentlemen, we offer to you Michael Moore’s idea for a 28th Amendment to the Constitution:
“A well regulated State National Guard, being helpful to the safety and security of a State in times of need, along with the strictly regulated right of the people to keep and bear a limited number of non-automatic Arms for sport and hunting, with respect to the primary right of all people to be free from gun violence, this shall not be infringed.”
Now what would this accomplish? Well, Moore is happy to expound on the extraordinary gun laws we could quickly pass if we had this new, weaker version of the Second Amendment. Laws like:
Requiring men to get legal permission from their wives/girlfriends before purchasing a gun!
Banning the sale and ownership of all auto and semi-auto guns!
Banning guns and magazines that can hold more than six rounds of ammo!
Mandatory “smart gun” technology that allows only the owner of a gun to pull the trigger!
And our favorite, which we’ll leave in its original, unedited form:
One’s guns must be stored at a licensed gun club or government-regulated gun storage facility. Believing that having a gun in your home provides you with protection is an American myth. People who die from a home invasion make up a sad but minuscule .04% of all gun murders in the US. And over a third of them are killed by their own gun that the criminal has either stolen or wrestled from them.
Moore doesn’t tell us what gun owners would have to go through in order to get their possessions out of these storage facilities or how long they would be allowed to hold onto them before the police come looking for them, and we’re not sure we really want to know the answers. Suffice to say that if Moore’s new and improved “gun rights” amendment allows for these kinds of laws, he could have saved himself the trouble of writing a replacement. Just abolish the Second Amendment and be done with it.
We don’t know what this country will look like in another two hundred years so we won’t make any long-term predictions, but we do know that this kind of dystopian nightmare is not coming to the U.S. in our lifetimes. This is nothing more or less than a revealing look into a left-wing, authoritarian fantasy, and it’s just about as disturbing as you might have guessed.

"http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/11/politics/tillerson-moron-comment/index.html
",Tense and difficult meeting preceded Tillerson's 'moron' comment,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's July 20 meeting at the Pentagon was a ""difficult and tense"" session that focused on a wide range of US security interests, multiple senior US officials told CNN on Wednesday.
It was after that session that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, in a private conversation with fellow US officials, exasperatedly called the President a ""moron,"" a comment that sparked new questions about the two men's relationship.
Trump denied a rift on Wednesday, but officials described a fraught session over the summer with top national security officials that led to the secretary of state's insult.
The broad-reaching session, held inside the secure conference room known as the ""tank,"" came a day after a White House situation room meeting on Afghanistan. Both meetings had been long scheduled to take place back-to-back.
The Pentagon briefing's focus was wider, however, ranging from various US treaty commitments to troop levels in different parts of the world to various other American interests, the sources said.
The White House meeting on Afghanistan had gone poorly, according to the sources. The President, displeased with the options he was being presented for managing America's longest war, suggested he wanted to fire the commander of US troops in Afghanistan, Army Gen. John Nicholson. And he compared the situation in the country to running a well-known Manhattan restaurant.
The meeting at the Pentagon a day later -- which had been scheduled for weeks -- was designed to give the President a broad tutorial on the global state-of-play, officials said. That's typical for meetings inside the Pentagon ""tank,"" which are meant to give presidents a global overview of threats and commitments.
Some officials deemed the session particularly necessary, given Trump's demonstrated lack of understanding about the issues involved.
""It was a rough day and people weren't focused on what the secretary said, they were focused on what the President said,"" one of the officials said. ""It was a rough session for the DOD people. They had their leadership questioned in a very direct way, and if anything came out from meeting, it was that.""
The official said that after the set of meetings, participants were ""ashen"" at Trump's direct questioning of his commanders and his lack of a nuanced world-view. Meetings held inside the Pentagon ""tank"" are usually sobering looks at the realm of global threats.
Over the course of the session, there wasn't a discussion of increasing the US nuclear arsenal, according to three sources.
But Trump has said previously that he would push for scaling up US nuclear capability.
He said in a Reuters interview earlier this year that he wanted a world with no nuclear weapons, but worries the United States has ""fallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity.""
""I am the first one that would like to see ... nobody have nukes, but we're never going to fall behind any country even if it's a friendly country, we're never going to fall behind on nuclear power,"" he said. ""It would be wonderful, a dream would be that no country would have nukes, but if countries are going to have nukes, we're going to be at the top of the pack.""
In December, before he was sworn in as President, Trump expressed a similar sentiment on Twitter.
""The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes,"" he wrote.
Several White House officials on Wednesday denied an NBC News report that Trump called for a nearly tenfold increase in the nuclear arsenal during the heated meeting that ultimately led to Tillerson referring to the President as a ""moron."" CNN has not confirmed the NBC report.
Speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump called that report ""fake news.""
""I never discussed it,"" Trump said ahead of talks with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""Right now we have so many nuclear weapons. I want them in perfect condition, perfect shape.""
""When they said I want 10 times what we have right now, it's totally unnecessary, believe me,"" Trump continued. ""It's got to be in tip-top shape.""
And Trump denied a rift has developed between himself and Tillerson.
""We actually have a very good relationship,"" he said, going on to concede that his views on North Korea do differ from those of his top diplomat.
""I think I have a little bit different attitude on North Korea than other people might have. And I listen to everybody,"" he said. ""But ultimately my attitude is the one that matters, isn't it? That's the way it works.""",1

",Week 4 Prediction Article - Oakland Raiders @ Denver Broncos,"Week 4 Prediction Article – Oakland Raiders @ Denver Broncos
(Before It's News)
Good morning Bronco fans! It is week 4 in the NFL as we are back at home against our division rivals, the Oakland Raiders. Both teams come into this contest with a record of 2-1 after losing in week 3. Both teams will look to rebound and continue to chase the division leading, 3-0 Kansas City Chiefs.
Oakland is coming off of a 27-10 loss to the Redskins and Denver is coming off of a 26-16 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Last week against the Redskins, the Oakland Raiders couldn’t muster up any offensive momentum as the Redskins dominated them throughout the whole game. QB Derek Carr was just 19 of 31 passing with 118 yards. Oakland will also be without the services of WR Michael Crabtree who is inactive today due to an injury. RB Marshawn “Beast Mode” Lynch will look to rebound after a poor start last week, in which he had just 6 carries for 18 yards.
Denver will look to avoid making costly mistakes on offense, as Trevor Siemian knows he must protect the “billion dollar” football. Turnovers have been a huge momentum killer for the Broncos this season as Siemian has now thrown 4 interceptions on the season. Denver certainly has the offensive weapons to give opposing teams nightmares with arguably one of the best WR duos in the league. Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders have combined for 33 receptions, 399 yards and 2 touchdowns, while WR Bennie Fowler is also making his presence known with 8 catches for 84 yards and 2 touchdowns of his own.
The Denver defense is ranked #1 in the NFL against the rush, allowing just under 60 yards per game. Their defense is also ranked 4th overall, allowing 263 yards per game. Washington showed the world how to manhandle and beat the Raiders, so the Broncos will just need to follow suit.
5 Keys to Victory
Get pressure on Derek Carr. Last week, Carr was sacked 4 times and pressured all day long. With the Denver secondary locking down receivers and the ferocious pass rush of the Broncos, getting into Carr’s head early will be a huge factor in this game.
Continue to run the football. With RBs C.J. Anderson and Jamal Charles, the Broncos have a formidable two-headed rushing attack. Anderson is averaging 4.4 yards per carry as Charles is averaging 5.1 yards per carry. Establish the run early and continue to pound the ball. Rush for over 100 yards, and I can see a Denver victory.
Keep Siemian upright. Oakland boasts one of the best pass rushers in the NFL with Khalil Mack. Mack has the ability to single handily disrupt the flow of a game and make huge, game changing plays. Protect the QB.
Again, win the turnover battle. Siemian must protect the football. This includes interceptions and strip sacks. Always know where Khalil Mack is and make smart throws, not throws across your body that goes to the other team.
Do not allow Marshawn Lynch to go into beast mode. Denver is going to have to attack the ball carrier, hold on tight and gang tackle. Lynch will run through arm tackles and make defenses pay dearly.
Final Score Prediction
Oakland Raiders – 13
Denver Broncos – 20

",Special Report: Brazil's gringo problem: its borders,"Coronel Joao Henrique Marinho of the Brazilian border police gives an interview to Reuters near the border with Bolivia in Caceres, Mato Grosso State, February 9, 2012. REUTERS/Nacho Doce
CACERES, Brazil (Reuters) - For the first 500 years of Brazil’s history, pretty much anything that wanted to cross its borders could do so in relative peace, whether cattle, Indians or intrepid explorers.
That era is now drawing to a close. Brazil’s economic rise is forcing it to deal with a problem it long regarded as the sole concern of rich countries like the United States: the need to secure its borders and slow down a flood of drugs, illegal immigrants and other contraband.
President Dilma Rousseff, under political pressure from a crack epidemic in Brazilian cities, is spending more than $8 billion and overhauling Brazil’s defense strategy to tackle an issue that has implications for trade, agriculture and the overall economy.
Brazil’s prosperity has created a new consumer class of tens of millions of people who happen to live right next to the world’s three biggest producers of cocaine: Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. Brazil is now the world’s No. 2 cocaine consumer, behind only the United States, according to U.S. government data. It is also a booming consumer of marijuana, ecstasy, and other narcotics.
Rousseff’s attempt to choke the flow of narcotics could mean big money for companies from Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer, which plans to make a new line of unmanned drones to patrol the border. Foreign firms like Boeing, Siemens and others stand to gain.
Securing an area that is five times longer than the U.S.-Mexico border, winding through more than 10,000 miles of Amazon jungle and 10 different countries, is proving to be a huge challenge. It is also sparking debate about whether it’s really worth the money and effort.
For Rafael Godoy de Campos Marconi, a police lieutenant at a lonely border checkpoint in the snake-infested Pantanal wetlands in western Brazil, the task can seem hopeless.
Marconi’s unit is responsible for patrolling a 125-mile stretch of border with Bolivia, the source of about 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in Brazil. On any given day, Marconi believes there are dozens of smugglers sloshing their way through his turf, with drugs stuffed into their shoes, pants and underwear.
The problem? Marconi usually only has 10 to 12 men to cover all that territory. Two weeks had passed since their last bust.
“Oh, they’re out there,” he sighed, scanning the horizon, sweating in the 100-degree heat and humidity. “But there are so few of us that they know exactly where we are.” Even with double his current resources, he said, it would be “very difficult” to control a region so deep in Brazil’s interior. With a wry smile, he mentioned a solution that was on the lips of a number of Brazilians here.
“Maybe if we built a wall, like the United States has (with Mexico),” he said. “Maybe then we can slow these people down.”
Brazil won’t be building any walls. But it is trying to absorb other lessons from the United States, and leaning on Washington for resources and technical advice. The head of Brazil’s armed forces traveled last year to El Paso, Texas, along the Mexican border, to meet with U.S. military and Department of Homeland Security officials.
Brazil’s new emphasis on its borders, and the obvious subtext - that it regards its neighbors with a growing wariness - is starting to prompt the kind of resentment around South America that used to be reserved for a certain large, English-speaking country to the north.
“It pains me to say it, but I’ve heard people say we’re the new gringos,” said Pedro Taques, a senator from Mato Grosso state, which borders Bolivia. “Controlling the border is a problem that Brazil never thought it would have to face ... and it’s forcing us to do some uncomfortable things.”
Nonetheless, Taques said that improved border protection was “critical” to the health of Brazil’s economy and society, and he expressed frustration that results have not come faster more than a year into Rousseff’s presidency. “Until now, we’ve seen lots of speeches,” he said. “But people who live on the border aren’t seeing enough results.”
AN INVISIBLE BORDER
It wasn’t so long ago that nobody took Brazil’s borders seriously - not even its presidents.
Fernando Henrique Cardoso wrote in his memoirs of taking a vacation to the Pantanal as president-elect in 1994, and wandering into Bolivia by mistake. Cardoso, his wife and a bodyguard were stopped an hour later by an armed Bolivian soldier who demanded to see their IDs. They had none.
“It took a good half hour of explaining, soothing and pleading, but we finally managed to convince the Bolivian soldier of my identity,” Cardoso wrote. “He said ... we were the first people he’d ever had to stop from crossing the Brazilian border, then apologized if he had scared us with the gun.”
There was historically little reason for protection on either side. Brazil has not gone to war with any of its neighbors since 1870. And for most of its history, hyperinflation and political instability meant that Brazil’s economy was merely average by South American standards. So, few people came looking for work.
That all began to change around the time Cardoso took office. Investor-friendly policies and poverty-reduction programs since then have made Brazil a star performer amid a broader shift in the global balance of power toward emerging markets. Brazil surpassed Britain last year as the world’s sixth-biggest economy, and it is now richer than all but three of its 10 neighbors on a per-capita basis.
That dynamism, and an unusually strong currency, have lured immigrants from around South America who often earn three to four times what they do back home. More than 1.46 million foreigners were formally registered in Brazil as of July 2011 - a 50 percent increase from the previous year alone.
The flood of foreign workers has helped alleviate a shortage of skilled labor as Brazil’s unemployment rate hits all-time lows. But it is also starting to cause unease, especially among the trade unions that form Rousseff’s political base.
Rousseff’s government vowed to toughen border controls and deportation practices in February after it gave amnesty to more than 4,000 Haitians who had entered Brazil illegally, most of them through the Amazon via Peru. The total number of undocumented immigrants in Brazil may run into the hundreds of thousands.
“Lots of these people are coming in search of the best jobs. That’s the problem,” said Paulo Pereira da Silva, a congressman and chief of Força Sindical, a powerful umbrella union group.
Brazil’s neglect of its borders has also contributed to a deluge of cheap imports that politicians say is damaging local industry. “Countless” goods from China and elsewhere have passed into Brazil undetected through neighboring countries, Trade Minister Fernando Pimentel said in an interview.

That said, the biggest issue - the one that President Rousseff emphasized when she unveiled her borders initiative in June 2011 - is a rise in drug use and its companion, organized crime.
Sao Paulo and other big cities have seen the emergence of “cracolandias” - literally “crack lands,” roving hordes of hundreds of people who gather at dusk to use crack in full view of the authorities. Media outlets have shocked the public by showing pregnant women and children younger than 12 smoking.
Drug gangs effectively control territory in several cities, including Rio de Janeiro, which will host the 2016 Olympic Games. The 2010 presidential campaign was arguably the first in Brazil’s history in which drug use emerged as a major issue, piling pressure on Rousseff to respond once she took office.
“One of the main priorities for (Rousseff), going back to the campaign, is the question of combating violence and drugs,” Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo said in an interview. “Controlling the borders is a critical part of that strategy.”
‘THIS IS A DISGRACE’
On the front lines, though, change has been slow.
At their post 30 miles west of the town of Caceres, Lt. Marconi and his fellow policemen live in tiny, elevated metal shacks. Chickens roam about, and men in cowboy hats ride by slowly on bicycles, seemingly oblivious to the police presence.
Even though it’s the only major police checkpoint in one of Brazil’s biggest drug-smuggling corridors, there is no on-site X-ray machine or scanner to detect narcotics in vehicles. For inspections, cars drive up onto a brittle-looking wooden platform. Drug-sniffing dogs are deployed only rarely, Marconi said.
“This is a disgrace,” said Mauro Zaque, a state prosecutor who was visiting the site. “You can’t tell me the state doesn’t have 2 million reais (about $1.1 million) to put a decent facility here. What’s missing is political will.”
The actual border is some 20 miles away. That led a visitor to ask: Can’t the smugglers just go around the post?
Marconi grimaced. “Yeah, many of them seem to do that.”
Authorities in the Pantanal region have detected countless “clandestine highways” - roads cleared by smugglers to get around the checkpoints. Especially elusive is the silent army of “mules” who cross over from Bolivia by foot, usually at night, and dump their cargo at covert way stations so that others can carry it to Brazilian cities. On patrol one afternoon, Marconi pointed out holes in fences on farms where he said the smugglers wriggle through.
The border itself is so poorly marked that Marconi sometimes didn’t know exactly where it was, crossing at several points into what may or may not have been Bolivia. “We shouldn’t stay here long,” he said at one point.

This is an easy region to patrol by Brazilian standards: flat and relatively treeless. By contrast, about 6,000 miles of Brazil’s border - or 60 percent of the total - is formed by rivers that flow downstream into Brazil from its neighbors, usually through thick jungle, making life simple for smugglers.
Rousseff and her senior officials say they are under no illusions about the obstacles they face.
“We can’t have this outdated vision that we’re going to accomplish this by placing a bunch of men in a line to protect 16,000 kilometers of border,” Rousseff said upon launching the borders initiative last year. “That’s not possible.”
Rousseff has focused instead on solutions that make use of Brazil’s existing manpower. One of her first moves was to expand the military’s role, essentially giving them police powers, like the ability to stop and search vehicles within 150 km, or 93 miles, of the border.
She has also demanded full coordination between the military and Brazil’s various police forces - something that never existed before. Lt. Marconi said that, in two years working on the border, he has had contact with the army only once. Apprised of this, Justice Minister Cardozo, who oversees the police, nodded grimly. “We’re working on it,” he said.
A new joint command center for border issues has been built inside the defense ministry. Vice President Michel Temer has begun hosting a new, regular cross-agency meeting of army and police that also brings together environmental, trade, and other officials.
The new focus amounts to a fundamental change for the armed forces, which governed Brazil as recently as 1985 and have played an uncertain, shifting role since democracy returned. Gen. Jose Carlos de Nardi, the head of Brazil’s military joint chiefs, hung a photo from his visit to El Paso, right by the door in his office in Brasilia as a reminder of the new priorities.
“It’s a change for us, certainly,” De Nardi said in an interview. “This is going to be a core part of our strategy for decades.”
‘NO SUCH THING’
Aware of the challenges faced by their men and women on the ground, De Nardi, Cardozo and others have concluded that the two biggest keys to Brazil’s success will be technology and intelligence work.
One of the most effective new tools, they say, is unmanned aerial drones that are capable of detecting boats, people and even cattle - a critical element to protecting Brazil’s $4 billion beef export industry, the world’s largest, from devastating plagues like foot-and-mouth disease.
Latest-generation Air Force jets, ground radar systems, riverboats and other equipment will also be acquired. De Nardi said that Brazil is only beginning to get the resources it needs, and there will be plenty of opportunities for both local and foreign companies. (See sidebar.)
“We’re going to need many tools,” he said.

Justice Minister Cardozo said the government will double the number of federal police in the border region by 2013, in part by obliging all new entrants to the force to spend time there. Facilities such as Lt. Marconi’s tiny shack will be upgraded, and a bill will be sent to Congress to provide a special salary incentive for officials working along the border, he said.
But the spending spree has left some Brazilians wondering if it will do much good, especially with regard to drugs. If the United States, with all the resources that the world’s biggest economy has to offer, can’t stop cocaine from coming across its borders, then how can Brazil?
Among the skeptics is former President Cardoso, who has emerged as a leading critic of the international “war on drugs.” He says that, while a greater degree of border security is necessary for economic and strategic reasons, Brazil is unlikely to be able to stand in the way of the enormous demand for narcotics.
“There’s no point,” said Cardoso, who advocates legalizing some so-called soft drugs such as marijuana. “The experience of Latin America during the past 30 years shows that resisting these forces only yields more violence.”
Indeed, Brazil is ramping up its efforts just as the countries around the region who have fought drug gangs the hardest in recent years, at enormous financial and human cost, seem to be starting to explore other alternatives.
Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said last year that he would “welcome” legalization if it took the profits out of smuggling. His Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderon, hinted in a September 2011 speech that he might be open to a similar move.
Colonel João Henrique Marinho, who commands the Brazilian army’s Second Border Battalion in Caceres, observed that, at present, Brazilian smugglers in the border region lack anything resembling the sophistication or firepower of cartels in Mexico or Colombia. Instead, they run what Marinho described as an “artisanal” operation based on smugglers and light aircraft.
Asked why local smugglers haven’t organized themselves into Mexican-style cartels, Marinho raised his eyebrows and replied: “Could it be because we’re not resisting them yet?”
OPERATIONS ABROAD
Concerns about drug cartels are just as keen on the other side of Brazil’s borders.
In the dusty Bolivian town of San Matias, just across from Caceres, locals say that they’ve already seen a frightening increase in the number of criminals over the past year. But the bad guys, they say, are Brazilians.
“It’s the Brazilians who run things around here,” said Jose Contreras, a local shopkeeper, making a trigger signal with his index finger. “You know, the Brazilians blame Bolivians for everything, but they’re the ones who rob and kill.”
“They use this as a base,” he said. “It’s getting worse.”
Justice Minister Cardozo acknowledged the misgivings about the government’s strategy, as well as the possible risks. But he said Brazil will press ahead.
Rousseff has ruled out legalization of drugs, telling Rolling Stone magazine in 2010 that “society isn’t ready for a change of that nature.” Cardozo pointed out that Brazil has already tried what amounted to a laissez-faire approach to drug issues - with disastrous results, visible in the country’s “crack lands,” gang-controlled slums and elsewhere.
Asked how Brazil can succeed where the United States has not, Cardozo said that the key is “to have a relationship with those (producer) countries, so the matter can be attacked on their territory.”
To that end, Brazil is starting to engage in practices that look a lot like what Washington has been doing around Latin America for decades. Cardozo said that Brazilian federal police agents went into Paraguay last year and destroyed marijuana plantations themselves with the permission of local authorities.
Cardozo said a similar program took place in Peruvian territory to eradicate coca plants - used to make cocaine - in August 2011. He also cited a new three-way cooperation agreement between the United States, Brazil and Bolivia, in which Brazilian forces will offer training and equipment to their Bolivian counterparts to fight drugs there. Felipe Caceres, Bolivia’s vice-minister for social defense, said the deal will help provide his country - South America’s poorest - with “logistical support to cover (our) extensive geography.”
Cardozo highlighted what he called significant progress since the borders plan was launched. From June 2011 through February 2012, Brazilian security forces seized 123 tons of marijuana and 17 tons of cocaine in joint operations on the border, according to justice ministry data. More than 5,500 people have been sent to jail as a result.
The seizures have also included stolen cars, firearms, ammunition, explosive material, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in other contraband that would have otherwise made their way into the country. “It’s a good start, and this is so important to protecting all sectors of our economy,” said Pimentel, the trade minister.
On the front lines, some are equally hopeful.
Augusto Cesar do Borges, an official for the agricultural monitoring agency INDEA, mans a tiny, new, air-conditioned checkpoint just across the border from San Matias that mostly checks passing cars for contraband.
Prior to 2007, there was no state presence here, and “anything could enter” Brazil, he said.
“This is all new to us, and we’re getting better,” Borges said. “Now, we just need more tools.”
Like what?
“I don’t know,” he said with a grin. “Maybe a wall.”",1

(Before It's News)
So who saw the Jets beating the Dolphins, Buffalo taking down Denver and the absolute beatdown Jacksonville just put on Baltimore across the pond? Sure wasn’t me. Just as unpredictable as the game itself, week 3 provided quite the list of major performances across the league: Stefon Diggs and Case Keenum dazzled against Tampa Bay, Chris Thompson made the most of his game against Oakland and in his first game of the season, Marcedes Lewis found the endzone in three times. If you managed to start all of these players last week, please show me your ways. In the meantime, let’s take a look at what Week 4 has in store for your fantasy matchups. Quarterback Fool me once, fool me twice with Cam Newton this season. After botching a prime matchup with the Saints, it’s safe to say the former NFL MVP is not quarterback he once was. He’s outside of my top 20 this week thanks to his early season performances. Meanwhile on the top half, the top four reign supreme again as they all enter the week with favorable matchups. Rodgers draws the Bears on Thursday night, and while Chicago got the best of the Green and Gold last time they played on a Thursday night, the Packers’ QB has thrown for 3+ touchdowns in four of their last six meetings. Past the top tier, the resurrection of Andy Dalton should continue this week against a bad Browns defense that just made Jacoby Brissett look like a pro bowler. Jay Cutler has his shot against the Saints. We’ll see if Newton was the outlier in regards to facing New Orleans.

Running Back I said it last week, I’ll say it again: all aboard the Kareem Hunt bandwagon! Hunt is well on his way to rookie of the year honors with no end in sight. The two right behind him in Elliott and Gurley are just as worthy of that #1 slot so you can’t go wrong among the top three here. Jordan Howard is the questionable play in the RB2 tier depending on how well his shoulder will do on short rest. Playing through the pain against Pittsburgh helped Chicago notch the victory, but at what price did it come? Yes, Mark Ingram looks to be the guy in New Orleans but I’m not sold just yet. It wouldn’t surprise me if Alvin Kamara works his way into the gameplan putting Ingram’s chances at fully breaking away from the pack on hold.

Wide Receiver The top three for this week got back to their dominant ways in Week 3 and should continue to do so this week. Considering what we mentioned above with the Browns making Jacoby Brissett look like a pro bowler, T.Y. Hilton reaped the benefits as should A.J. Green from Andy Dalton this week. DeVante Parker may be in for a huge week against the Saints. As the Jay we’ve all come to know and love, Parker’s QB has locked on to the young receiver early on this season providing plenty of opportunities. The 20s in this week’s rankings are chock full of opportunity between Tate, Cooper, Bryant and Hogan among others. It’s safe to say wide receiver is once again pulling away from the pack as the deepest position in the game yet again.

Tight End Kudos to every fantasy owner out there that avoided the Week 3 minefield at tight end. Gronk produced like we expected and Ertz put up yet another impressive stat line earning them 1-2 in this week’s rankings, but past that was a hot mess. Kelce, Walker, Rudolph, Witten and Bennett did not show as expected, add in the annual injuries to Jordan Reed and Tyler Eifert and you have yourself a crapshoot. Charles Clay is quietly emerging as a top option at the tight end position and should get his fair share of opportunities if Buffalo falls behind in Atlanta. Once again it’s looking like we’ll be playing the mystery game between Antonio Gates and Hunter Henry in Los Angeles. Avoid this situation as much as possible.

Defense/Special Teams Seattle returns home to a much needed matchup with the lowly Colts, they should produce accordingly, same goes for Jacksonville getting a matchup with New York fresh off their demolishing of Baltimore (although a jet lag concern does remain). Cincinnati has been lights out against the Browns in previous seasons and 2017 looks to be no different now that the offense has regained their stature. Looking at options past the top 12 this week, there aren’t too many enticing options. If you’re digging for a streaming D/ST, the Chargers will have the chance to take advantage of the Eagles’ vertical passing game that has been prone to mistakes early on, not to mention they just lost Darren Sproles for the season.

",What we still don't know about the Las Vegas shooting,"(CNN) The gunman's motive, the timeline of the shooting and why he stopped shooting -- these are among the wealth of unanswered questions that persist after 11 days of investigation into the Las Vegas music festival massacre.
The lack of answers, especially about the timeline, seems all the more curious when, it would appear, that many moments in the shooter's days-long preparation -- and the actual assault -- were captured by hotel video surveillance or by cameras the gunman himself installed in his suite and hallway.
Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo has asked the public for patience, saying authorities are trying to ""draw the most accurate picture"" of how the shooting unfolded.
Federal and local agencies continue collecting evidence, delving into the gunman's life and interviewing those close to him.
""There's more than 20,000 moving parts associated with this investigation and it takes time,"" the sheriff told CNN affiliate KLAS on Wednesday.
Here's what we still don't know about the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history
What happened in the 6 minutes after the hotel security guard was shot?
In a new timeline of events, police say Stephen Paddock shot security guard Jesus Campos six minutes before the gunman opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest music festival from his room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.
An open door to a room near Paddock's suite had set off an alarm, prompting Campos to respond.
Paddock opened fire at 10:05 p.m. and unleashed bullets on concertgoers for about 10 minutes. The police didn't get to Paddock's 32nd-floor suite until 10:17 p.m. They didn't breach the room until 11:20 p.m., after a SWAT team arrived with explosive charges, Lombardo said.
Lombardo said Campos, upon being shot, notified security, and his action helped pinpoint the suspect's location.
JUST WATCHED Hotel worker gives account of Vegas shooting Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hotel worker gives account of Vegas shooting 01:34
Police didn't know Campos was shot until they met him on the 32nd floor, Lombardo said.
It's still unclear who Campos initially contacted and what happened in the six minutes between Campos being shot and Paddock opening fire on the festival. Also fuzzy: Why did it take 18 minutes for officers to reach the 32nd floor?
A lawsuit filed by shooting victim Paige Gasper accuses MGM Resorts International, which owns the Mandalay Bay and the festival venue, of failing to respond in a timely manner after Campos was shot.
MGM has said it feels the timeline provided by police ""may not be accurate."" On Thursday, the company issued a statement saying it would respond to Gasper's allegations ""through the appropriate legal channels.""
""As our company and city work through the healing process, our primary focus and concern is taking actions to support the victims and their families, our guests and employees and cooperating with law enforcement,"" it said.
Is the new timeline of events correct?
Lombardo told KLAS the timeline is not static.
""Nobody's trying to hide anything. What we want to do is draw the most accurate picture we can,"" Lombardo said. ""That timeline might change again.""
Responding to MGM, a law enforcement source close to the investigation said police stand by the timeline, calling it ""pretty accurate with all the facts known.""
Why did Paddock stop shooting after 10 minutes?
Police initially said Campos distracted Paddock and that Paddock quit firing out the window after shooting Campos.
Now, police say Campos was shot before Paddock's rampage began. It's unclear why Paddock stopped shooting into the festival crowd after 10 minutes.
When SWAT officers breached Paddock's door, they discovered the gunman dead, apparently of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
How could he meticulously plan this kind of attack without anyone noticing?
Over several days, Paddock took guns and ammunition to his hotel suite. He had 23 weapons in his room. In his car were more than 50 pounds of explosives and 1,600 rounds of ammunition, police said. Twelve of the firearms had bump stocks -- legal accessories for rifles that enable them to be fired more rapidly.
Authorities also found a note containing calculations on distance and trajectory to the concertgoers below, according to a law enforcement source.
Lombardo said they have found ""no evidence to show there was a second shooter.""
Authorities have received 200 accounts of Paddock traveling around Las Vegas, and that he ""has never been seen with anyone else,"" the sheriff said.
Through her attorney , Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, said it ""never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence.""
What was he planning to do with the explosives in his car?
Investigators learned Paddock had ""personal protection equipment with him,"" Lombardo told reporters Monday, leading authorities to believe he planned more than a mass shooting.
""We know he attempted to shoot at fuel tanks,"" Lombardo said. ""I would be comfortable saying, depending on the splash he made during the shooting, it would enable first responders to draw their attention to other locations, which would allow Paddock to just leave the hotel.""
Why did he do it?
Authorities have received more than 1,000 tips but still have no credible information on Paddock's motive.
Lombardo admitted the slow speed of the investigation frustrated him.
""It's because this individual purposely hid his actions leading up to this event and it is difficult for us to find the answers to those actions,"" he said.
Nothing about Paddock's life provides clues as to why he would have meticulously planned and perpetrated mass murder. The 64-year-old retired accountant had no apparent political or religious affiliations , one of his brothers said.
Paddock would wager up to $1 million a night but wandered around casinos in sweatpants and flip-flops. He carried his own drink into the high rollers' area because he didn't want to tip the waitresses much, according to a deposition obtained exclusively by CNN that was part of a 2013 civil lawsuit Paddock brought against the Cosmopolitan Hotel over a fall.
He had no criminal record. His purchase of an arsenal raised no red flags.
""Currently, we do not believe there is one particular event in the suspect's life for us to key on,"" the sheriff said.
In the 2013 deposition, Paddock said he had no mental issues or addictions.
Over the years, he owned apartments and houses in Nevada, Florida and California. Most recently, he lived in a retiree community in Mesquite, Nevada, northeast of Las Vegas.
He kept a low profile . Some neighbors rarely saw him.
In September, Paddock rented a room at a Las Vegas condo complex that overlooked the Life Is Beautiful music festival.",1

Vice President Mike Pence hosts the first meeting of the National Space Council Thursday morning kicking off the Trump administration’s bid to “make America’s space program great again.” “At President Trump’s direction, the kick-off meeting of the National Space Council will bring together all aspects and sectors of the national space enterprise for the first time in a quarter-century,” said Vice President Pence. “This meeting will provide an opportunity for the Administration to lay out its vision for space exploration. As President Trump said, ‘We’re a nation of pioneers, and the next great American frontier is space.’ ” “This high-level group advises the president and comprises the leaders of government agencies with a stake in space, including the NASA administrator, the Secretaries of State, Commerce, Defense, and others, and will be chaired by Vice President Mike Pence,” acting NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot said in a statement. “It will help ensure that all aspects of the nation’s space power — national security, commerce, international relations, exploration, and science, are coordinated and aligned to best serve the American people.” President Donald Trump signed an executive order reestablishing the National Space Council on June 30, 2017. Currently confirmed council members of the first …

In an ongoing public relations tidal wave on tax reform, the House Republicans released a video that tries to answer the question “why does tax reform matter to you?”
More time with family, higher take-home pay, more good-paying jobs and advantages for small business owners are just some of the points the video kinda makes.
The short presentation follows a set of appearances, tweets, facebook posts and statements made by Paul Ryan and House members pushing tax reform. But, educating Americans isn’t going to pass the bill – or even get it out of committee. It’s popular, Americans want it so quit selling and close the deal.
Whether or not real tax reform, with easier filing, less complexity, and lower taxation, is up to Congress. And the people will call, email, fax, and write their members until this is passed.
Failure to pass reform will continue the growing wave of anti-incumbent, anti-Washington sentiment that will impact both Republicans and Democrats.
Oh yeah… here’s that barely informative video they released:

It’s finally here.
Today starts Game 1 of the ALDS and this is going to be one heck of a tough series. It feels good to FINALLY be in the postseason again, but this is an ugly “welcome back to the ALDS” match-up and the Yankees are gonna have to be on their A+ game to win this series. Here are some key things that have to happen (the most important ones) to get past the Indians.
Photo: MLB.com
1. WIN the first game
I have always liked Terry Francona because he isn’t afraid to take a risk and he is smart. Game one is important to the Yankees because Francona has opted to start Trevor Bauer INSTEAD of Corey Kluber, but don’t be fooled because that is all by design. Normally, managers start their best pitcher one Game one but not this time. Bauer is a good pitcher, but he is no Kluber. Realistically, Kluber is likely to be the AL Cy Young winner at least in my opinion. I think he gets it over Chris Sale.
Photo: MLB.com
Pitching Bauer before Kluber means Kluber could pitch games two and then five on regular rest. Kluber on regular rest is very important to the Indians. They have asked him to pitch on short rest three times last year in the postseason and they don’t want to do that again yet. The Indians ace is lined up for two games in this series. Winning Thursday in Cleveland will give the Yankees momentum, and if you like interesting tidbits like me, teams who win the first game in a best of five series statistically go on to win that series 71% of the time. It’s a nice stat…..and an even better one if Francona knows it and loses. Let’s make the Indians a little uncomfortable and if Sonny Gray pitches a great game and out offense handles Bauer we carry the momentum.

I hate to say it but the first game is basically a MUST WIN. Chad Green and David Robertson will be unavailable for game One, so that will hurt. The last thing the Yankees want to do is drop the first game and have to worry about a potential 0-2 deficit with Kluber on the mound tomorrow.

2. Battle through Kluber & DON’T give up
Game two is going to be hard! This matchup is going to be interesting with former Indians ace CC Sabathia dueling against current ace Kluber. I am intrigued already. The Yankees have a lot of experience with CC on the mound but they have not had much success against Kluber.
Photo: Getty Images
Looking at the Yankee lineup Jacoby Ellsbury has the most success against him at 5-for-19. The Yankees will need to try and drive up his pitch count and capitalize on any of his mistakes which seems unlikely, but so far pitchers have had a rough time in this early postseason so it’s possible. Even if the Yankees manage to get Kluber out early their bullpen is similar to the Yankees and have some great arms like former Yankee Andrew Miller. Luckily in game two Green and Robertson will be available if needed.
3. Rain is in the forecast for Friday
The current forecast has it raining ALL DAY in Cleveland. If that is the case, the game would likely be postponed until Saturday. That would mean three games in a row which could be bad for the bullpens BUT it could be a major advantage for the Yankees. The Indians want to pitch Kluber on regular five day rest as mentioned above…..if game 2 is moved to Saturday and he has to pitch in it he would be starting on short rest. Hmmmm. I like the potential hole in Francona’s masterful plan.

4. Take advantage of Yankee home games
The Yankees have very different splits with home and away games. Their away record this year was 40-41 but at home they are 52-30 if you count their Wild Card win the other night. The Yankees know how to capitalize on their short right porch and have lefty power to send balls over the wall. Not to mention there is nothing like playing in Yankee stadium in the playoffs. Ask Aaron Judge how electric the crowd was Tuesday night. The Yankees can feed off of that energy and use it to their advantage.
Photo: Getty Images
5. Arms & bats need to do their jobs
The bullpen is going to be a difference maker here. Both teams have a deep bullpen but there is nothing quite like the combination of Yankee relievers. The reliable Dellin Betances will need to show up and be effective and Joe Girardi will have plenty of arms to mix and match to whatever his binder tells him to do. The bats also need to do their job.
Photo: Getty Images
The Yankees will need Judge, Gary Sanchez and Didi Gregorius to set the tone and stay hot at the top of the order like the did against the Twins. The rest of the lineup will need to keep the hits going.
The Yankees are the underdog in this series, but anything can happen in the postseason. The Indians had everything go their way in the regular season and want to finish what they started last year with a ring. The Yankees surpassed everyone’s expectations and are hungry to prove everyone wrong.
Who wants it more? We are about to find out….bring it on, Indians!

"http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/11/media/trump-nbc-licenses-tweet/index.html
","Trump continues NBC threats, says 'licenses must be challenged'","President Trump started and ended his day Wednesday by lashing out at NBC and other American television networks. He explicitly threatened the press by saying on Twitter that ""network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked.""
It was a follow-up to the morning missive that reflected his fury over an NBC News report that said he wanted a tenfold increase in the United States' nuclear arsenal. He decried ""fake news coming out of NBC and the Networks"" and asked ""At what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!""
So the president is asserting that media companies which report aggressively about his administration should be punished by having their television station licenses scrutinized and possibly revoked.
In between those two tweets, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he found it ""frankly disgusting the press is able to write whatever it wants to write.""
Freedom of the press is a core principle of the U.S. Constitution.
When a reporter followed up and asked whether he believed there ""should be limits on what the press should write,"" Trump said, ""No. The press should speak more honestly.""
Still, his comment raised eyebrows, especially because it was the latest remark in a string of heightened ""fake news"" attacks Trump has leveled against the press in recent days.
Trump's new comments were condemned by press freedom organizations and some former government officials.
But his threat about TV licenses is essentially toothless.
First of all, there is no single license for NBC or any other national television network. Licenses are granted to individual local stations -- and NBC doesn't even own most of the stations that broadcast its content across the country. And it is extremely unusual for any station's license to be taken away for any reason, much less for a political vendetta.
The licenses for local television stations are subject to review by the Federal Communications Commission every eight years.
It would not be possible for Trump or his allies to challenge all of the licenses held by NBC in one fell swoop. Residents would have to submit complaints about individual stations to the FCC on a market-by-market basis.
The president seems to be encouraging that with his Wednesday night tweet.
There is precedent for political allies of a president challenging local licenses. It happened under Richard Nixon in the 1970s, when a friend of Nixon's tried to take over a license held by the Washington Post. Nixon's ally did not succeed in his bid.
Short of gross misconduct on the part of a challenged station, it's unlikely any other such attempt now would be successful either.
""Whatever other legal problems [NBC parent] Comcast may have, this is not one of them,"" Andrew Jay Schwartzman, an attorney who works at the Georgetown University Law Center and specializes in telecommunications law, told CNN. ""Comcast knows full well that the FCC will never, ever, deny its license renewal applications.""
The FCC is technically an independent body, not subject to the president's orders. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai -- who is a Republican appointed to his current post by Trump -- said in March that his job is not to be a ""political actor.""
""It is simply to be somebody at the FCC who, as I said, is administering the laws of the United States,"" Pai said. ""I'm simply not going to wade into that kind of political debate.""
Neither Pai nor an FCC spokesperson immediately responded to requests for comment about Trump's tweet. But former FCC officials were quick to skewer the president.
""To me it's just incomprehensible that because of the content of NBC News that somehow their license would be at risk,"" Alfred Sykes, a Republican who served as chairman of the FCC under George H.W. Bush, told The Wrap.
""This madcap threat, if pursued, would be blatant and unacceptable intervention in the decisions of an independent agency,"" echoed Michael Copps, a Democrat who served as FCC commissioner under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, in a statement to HuffPost. ""The law does not countenance such interference. President Trump might be happier as emperor, but I think the American people would strip him of his clothes on this issue.""
A spokesperson for NBC declined to comment.
Trump has increased his attacks on the media in the past week. Last week, he urged the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate news outlets for publishing supposed ""fake"" stories. Over the weekend, he hinted it was perhaps time for a law that would require broadcasters to give equal time to both sides of the political debate when discussing public policy.
""At what point are we going to silence media critical of the President?"" tweeted Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. ""When we cease to have a First Amendment and a democratic government.""",1

",Smart Billboards Target Individual Motorists and Spy on License Plates and Cellphones,"By MassPrivateI
Editor’s Note: This is the Minority Report world we have entered. Please also see the article by Nicholas West which covers the use of billboards to predict people’s political views. This is already being used in many areas around the world; it’s called “neuropolitics.” Naturally, this is terrific for advertisers in our digitally connected world of smart devices that monitor us at all times.
Imagine driving down a highway and seeing a personalized billboard ad directed at you. Now imagine advertisers using billboards to send messages to your smartphone.
That’s the future of’ ‘advertised spying’ in America. (Yes, I made that term up.)
An article in McClatchy, warns that a new generation of “smart digital billboards will detect the make, model and year of oncoming vehicles and project ads tailored to the motorist.”
The article ominously warns that smart billboards can guess a motorist’s home address, age, race and income level based on the vehicle they are driving. And also claims that advertisers will be able to send messages to a person’s smartphone as they pass by a smart billboard.
Companies like SYNAPS want to create a network of spying billboards.
SYNAPS, boasts about ‘designing intelligent sensors that recognize car models and help a billboard choose the best message for their drivers’.
SYNAPS, describes how advertisers can personalize their advertising…
It really is up to you to choose who will see your advertising – and it does not matter, where the billboard is. Pick your segment based on a specific car model and age, car price or size, or even how conservative or modern it is. (Source)
MIT’s connection to spying billboards
SYNAPS, appears to have gotten its start in Russia, as a recent article in MIT Technology Review points out.
Co-founders Alex Pustov and Alesky Utkin expect to be operating 20-50 smart billboards in Russia this year. They also claim to encrypt all the license plate data they collect.
Would you trust a foreign company with our license plate data?
What is MIT’s connection to SYNAPS?
According to SYNAPS, their American business is located at MIT’s Martin Trust in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
What does Martin Trust do?

SYNAPS is not the only company using smart billboards to target and track our travel patterns. Since 2015, automakers Lexus, GM and Chevrolet (seen below) have been using smart billboards to spy on motorists.
Earlier this year, General Motors received requests from numerous automotive companies and car dealerships to purchase their smart billboards. FYI, GM has also been using facial recognition billboards to spy on people.
Last year, Yahoo patented a smart billboard that uses cameras and microphones to spy on everyone.

We should assume that law enforcement will have access to smart billboard data just like they have with CCTV cameras.
Smart billboards coupled with CCTV cameras will create a huge surveillance network that would rival the United Kingdom for the most spied on nation in the world.

",J&F calls Brazil judge decision to freeze assets 'legally fragile',"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A decision on Friday by a Brazilian federal judge to freeze the assets and companies of the billionaire Batista family is “legally fragile” because it is based on newspaper reports and not on prior judicial rulings, the lawyers representing the family’s investment holding company J&F Investimentos SA said.
In a statement, the lawyers said a decision by Federal Judge Ricardo Leite of the 10th District Court of Brasília demanding the family deposits 1.6 billion reais ($506 million) to compensate state development bank BNDES is unjustified because J&F was to pay a slightly bigger fine as part of a May leniency accord.
Earlier in the day, Leite ordered the assets of the Batistas be frozen as part of an investigation.

During the first Bill Clinton presidential campaign, Hillary swore to “stand by her man” and make him cookies, much like a typical housewife would do, and contrary to everything she believes in today.
During Bill Clinton’s re-election campaign Hillary headed up the Bimbo Eruption squad that attacked women who mentioned their relations with Bill. So these women who opposed the bad treatment that Bill meted out are, in Hillary’s opinion, bad women when they complain about Bill’s bad acts? Meanwhile, feminists call all men predators and let Bill slide.
During her post-White House years, Hillary proclaimed that women should be treated equally with men. As a test of just how serious feminists are with the women being equal to men thing, recently Joy Behar, of The View television show, criticized Mike Huckabee for allowing his daughter to work for Donald Trump’s administration, as though his daughter could not make up her own mind whom to work for, and as though Donald Trump is nearly the risk for a woman to work for that Bill Clinton is. Just ask Monica Lewinski.
During Hillary’s Senate and Secretary of State years, while she insisted that women should be paid equally with men, she consistently paid women on her staff less than her male employees.
During Hillary’s own presidential candidacy she ran as a female victim to be pitied for her mistreatment, and in her speeches she told every woman that they must vote for her or they would be letting all women down, indicating that voting for Hillary was an obligation owed her by all women. But would one be mistaken to believe that the president serves the entire nation and not only the female part of the nation? Does Hillary, given her self-absorption and her radical feminism, understand this aspect of the presidency?
During Hillary’s 2016 post-presidential run she claimed that American women allowed their husbands to instruct them to vote for Trump and not her. Does Hillary really believe that women are so stupid and weak that they can be told for whom to vote?
These examples of flip-flopping are a separate subject from the many lies Hillary has told publicly, such as flying into a war zone with Chelsea on board the aircraft and having to cork-screw down in order to avoid enemy fire while landing, and getting her first name as a sign of her mother’s respect for Sir Edmond Hillary after he scaled Mount Everest.
Hillary will use any misguided illogic to get votes and followers. One time she’ll be the dutiful wife, the next time she’ll be a con-woman trying to force all women to vote for her out of a misguided sense of duty to all other women, and then she’ll be abusive to her political base as she criticizes any woman as being a traitor if they didn’t cast a vote for her. It sounds like Hillary is against the principle of letting women make up their own minds about who is the best candidate to represent them for president. It reminds one of Hillary’s “deplorable” comments which lost her many votes in the last election.
It’s too bad Hillary is just unable to gain people’s votes, men’s and women’s alike, based on her being a good candidate and not a shrill, unpleasant liar every time she opens her mouth. But given her inability to will elections, I kind of like her just the way she is.

",Judicial Reform Activist and Attorney Abducted by Police While Broadcasting,"By Janet Phelan
Judicial reform activist and radio personality Andy Ostrowski has been taken into custody against his will and forced into a psychiatric evaluation. His abduction took place yesterday, September 19, at approximately 3 pm in Wilkes-Barre, PA, where Ostrowski resides.
Ostrowski was taken while on Facebook live and the incident was captured on video. The video is available here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=Ig_YZ1BgiYw&feature=youtu.be
The video reveals an obviously anxious Ostrowski stating he had just seen a Wilkes-Barre police officer climbing over his fence. He says, “I am staying on Facebook live here til someone pulls me off the air.”
“Andy Ostrowski has done nothing wrong to anyone,” he says on the video.” Andy Ostrowski has done nothing but hit enter on emails and things on Facebook.” At that juncture, Ostrowski suddenly stated that two police officers had just entered his house, wearing gloves and carrying tasers In the background, one can hear the officers ordering him to stand up while he repeatedly asks for to see the warrant. One then hears the off-camera officer saying he has a warrant to take him into custody for a mental health evaluation. The camera then goes dark.
Ostrowski was reached a couple hours later at the General Hospital crisis unit. According to Ostrowski, he was not shown a valid, signed warrant for his detention. He discussed the history of the efforts in Wilkes-Barre to deprive him of his freedom, stating that he was being held as a political prisoner.
In a wide ranging conversation, he talked about his career as a civil rights attorney and how his efforts to impact racial discrimination very likely got him suspended from the practice of law, in 2010. “I was representing minority business contractors,” he stated, “and their bids, which were really good, were being systematically rejected.” The lawsuits he filed put him in direct opposition with Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, who later became Director of the Department of Homeland Security.
Speaking of what he uncovered as a racial agenda, Ostrowski said, “We are looking at world domination by white men.”
Ostrowski previously hosted a radio show on Twigs Cafe, which discussed issues surrounding legal corruption. He recently made what he termed a “Declaration of Independence” from the United States, which he states is occupied by a foreign power. In July of this year, he filed a federal lawsuit naming the “American System of Justice” as a primary defendant.
Ostrowski had teamed up with noted civil rights attorney Don Bailey, whose battle for his law license got national press coverage. Bailey, a former Pennsylvania Congressman, was disbarred by the US Supreme Court in 2014 for making statements that judges were corrupt, among other accusations of legal corruption. Ostrowski recalls that he was told that “They wanted me out of the way so I couldn’t help Bailey.”
From his hospital confinement today, Ostrowski appeared emotional but lucid. “They don’t have the balls to give me due process or charge me with a crime,” he asserted, “so they are going for mental health imprisonment.”
“I am never backing down on a word I have said,” he stated.
According to Ostrowski, he was detained twice previously this year for an evaluation and was told by the assigned psychiatrist that “Next time, we are putting you into a state institution.”
Ostrowski will be evaluated by the crisis team and can be held for 72 hours. At that time, if he is still considered a “threat to himself or others,” he can be detained for a month. Pennsylvania law guarantees a hearing after the 72 hour hold expires and, should he be further detained, after the 30 days.
Wilkes Barre is located in Luzerne County, the locus of the infamous “Kids for Cash” judicial scandal.

",Australia dual citizenship saga: Court hearing begins,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Barnaby Joyce inherited New Zealand citizenship from his father
An Australian court has begun a long-awaited hearing into whether seven MPs caught up in a dual citizenship saga should remain eligible for office.
Under constitutional rules, Australian politicians cannot be dual citizens.
The High Court of Australia will clarify whether there are any exceptions, such as for those who did not know they were dual nationals.
If Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce is disqualified, the government could lose its one-seat majority.
The government will argue that only two politicians who ""voluntarily obtained, or retained"" dual status should be disqualified.
The other five politicians, including Mr Joyce, were unknowing recipients and should remain eligible, according to the government's defence.
The hearing will last three days. A ruling could be made as early as Thursday, but the court may decide that longer deliberations are necessary.
Potential consequences
The cases involve Mr Joyce and his government colleagues Fiona Nash and Matt Canavan, as well as four politicians from minor parties - Malcolm Roberts, Nick Xenophon, Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam.
Mr Joyce will attract the most interest because he sits in the lower House of Representatives, where the party with the most MPs forms the government. The others were elected to the Senate.
If Mr Joyce loses his seat, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull could oversee a minority government, but the potential outcomes are complex.
The citizenship revelations began in July when New Zealand-born Mr Ludlam, from the Greens, announced he was a dual national.
It prompted dozens of politicians to make public statements about their status.
The court will hear submissions from the seven politicians, the government, and an independent challenger, former MP Tony Windsor.",1

More than 150 people are missing in wildfires that have ravaged northern California's wine region, police say.
At least 17 people are now confirmed dead and more than 2,000 buildings have been destroyed by the fires which broke out on Sunday.
Eleven of the deaths have been in Sonoma County.
One of the worst affected towns there is Santa Rosa, north of San Francisco, where entire districts have been destroyed.
The Sonoma County sheriff's office said 155 people were still unaccounted for, although that could be due to the chaotic pace of the evacuations.
In neighbouring Napa County, victims included 100-year-old Charles Rippey and his 98-year-old wife, Sarah, police said.
The fires are among the deadliest in California's history and have sent smoke as far south as San Francisco, about 60 miles (100km) away.

Commie-lite crackpot Bernie Sanders has become a political force among young, uneducated and unskilled Americans because like the candy man, he is promising them free stuff. Free college tuition, free health insurance and other socialist bennies which someone inevitably has to pay for and it won’t be Bernie’s Bolsheviks. One of the more popular crusades of the socialist left is the so-called “Fight For $15” which pushes for a national $15 an hour minimum wage that will unite the burger flippers of the world. What Bernie and his fellow con artists in the Democratic party fail to tell their young dupes is that by having the government mandate $15 an hour for jobs that you could get trained monkeys to do more accurately, that they will eventually end up on the losing end as employers cut staffing and raise prices to accommodate the higher wages. Some companies are on the cutting edge and look to eliminate the need for these workers entirely through increased automation and the introduction of robotics into your local fast food emporiums.

","Entire Volume of CIA Files On Lee Harvey Oswald, Set to Be Released in October, Has ""Gone Missing""","By Jack Burns
Countless concerned individuals are still searching for answers surrounding the mysterious death of the 35th president of the United States, John F. Kennedy. The official narrative, that a lone former Marine named Harvey Oswald assassinated him, is widely disputed.
All available documents from all government entities are required by the Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 to be released on October 26th of 2017. But if history repeats itself, the Central Intelligence Agency may not release an entire volume of documents on Oswald, known as “volume 5.”
As Sputnik reports, the release in July of 3,810 CIA and FBI documents on the assassination by the Assassination Records Review Board threw up a number of revelations that JFK researchers have hungrily devoured and enthusiastically publicized. For instance, the mayor of Dallas at the time of Kennedy’s assassination, Earle Cabell, was a CIA asset in the 1950s, and his brother, Charles Cabell, a high-ranking CIA official until 1962.
The release in October has been highly anticipated by those seeking answers. However, thanks to a deliberate fudging or records, or a conveniently timed clerical error, an entire volume may never see the light of day.
Inside Langley Air Force Base’s CIA Headquarters is an office known as the Office of Security. The Office of Security maintains its own top-secret archives known as the Office of Security Archival Holdings and is a separate archive from the agency’s more frequently used facility located in Alexandria, VA known as the Agency Archival Record Center.
As late as 1977, the entire 7-volume collection of documents was intact, having been checked out by Russ Holmes in the Office of General Counsel and noted the 7-volume series was all together, not missing any volumes. But when the CIA was asked to turn over the volume of documents on Oswald, the hitman in the assassination, it seems the agency stonewalled a bit, like a shell game according to independent investigator Malcolm Blunt.
Blunt described the stonewalling:
This huge search by CIA did not surface Oswald’s security files and the Assassination Records Review Board (AARB) remained uninformed about their existence. Not until 1997 when an ARRB staffer stumbled across evidence that two previous congressional investigations had access to these files did CIA “discover” them.
The AARB eventually received the 7-volume set of documents on Oswald in 1998, but staffers quickly realized there was one volume missing—volume 5.
An agency explanation was offered that volume 5 could have been consolidated into Volume 4, or Volume 6 for example. Eventually, the agency concluded, according to Blunt, Volume 5 of Oswald’s Security file may never have existed.
So far, 2017 has been a year of anticipation for JFK conspiracy theorists as they await the release of all files surrounding the assassination of one of the country’s most beloved presidents. One group, known as the Citizens Against Political Assassinations, is chomping at the bits to get to volume 5 and others. They believe the official government narrative is full of holes and needs to be investigated.
Many of its members are lawyers, and as TFTP has reported, have desired to clear Oswald’s name of any wrongdoing if possible.
But it is attorney Lawrence Schnapf, Chair of the Environmental Law Section of the New York Bar Association, whose comments concerning the current president and his relationship with the Deep State (implied but not referred to as such) have the media ablaze with talk of yet another political assassination.
Schnapf is the co-chair of the CAPA legal committee. After a brief discussion of why JFK’s assassination is relevant today, Schnapf compared the early 1960s with 2017. He said the Warren Commission was the “original fake news” organization whose conclusions later became the official government narrative. Although the commission refused to pursue “exculpatory” information, which is now hidden behind “government secrecy,” he says he hopes will come out this year, in compliance with the JFK Assassination Records Act.
Turning attention again to the case of JFK, the group plans to use the shell casings found on the scene and 21st-century ballistics analyses to conclusively determine whether or not Oswald actually killed JFK.
He said they’re first going to conduct a mock trial in November, and later an official legal proceeding called a “Court of Inquiry,” an official court proceeding to definitely prove “Lee Oswald was not the shooter…that’s what we hope to prove.”
The group hopes to expunge Oswald’s name from the official narrative, clearing not only his, but also his daughter’s, to “expunge the stain of their father’s name from” theirs.
“Oswald was not convictable, much less indictable,” he concluded.
The reputable lawyer contends that the mainstream media often overlooks the real story —that the government is not transparent — and that the Department of Justice (which also includes the FBI) has been politicized.

",Art for Independence,"By Josef Dobraszczyk (words) & Camila Calderoni (images)
The state of Chiapas hosts some of the most spectacular scenery in perhaps all of Mexico, from dense tropical jungles to sweeping green mountain canyons. It is also officially the poorest state, with one of the highest percentage of indigenous populations, often reliant on small-scale subsistence farming for survival. Within this incredibly diverse state, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) has existed for over 24 years. Primarily an indigenous lands rights struggle, ‘Zapatismo’ has sought to offer a radically different model of decentralized governance, ideologically placing itself as a living alternative to Neoliberal Capitalism within a global struggle.
This movement came to international prominence on January 1st 1994, with a state-wide insurrection timed to coincide exactly with the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the US, Mexico and Canada. Amongst many other conditions pressured by the US government of the time, NAFTA put an end to communal land rights held within the Mexican constitution since the 1917 revolution, affecting up to 25 million peasant farmers. Losing any faith in official cooperation after years of government affronts to indigenous communities, the Zapatistas looked instead to uprising and autonomous organization as their only remaining option. Many thousands in Chiapas took hope and inspiration from this action, with hundreds of villages choosing to declare themselves ‘autonomous’, free from government rule but organized under the networked umbrella of ‘Zapatismo’.
Although predominantly based in such rural and indigenous communities, Zapatismo finds its greatest urban support base in the city of San Cristobal, a colourful and artistic city, well visited on the backpacker-tourist trail. Zapatista imagery can be found in countless bars, cafes and shops across the centre, yet the movement keep many of their activities relatively private for numerous reasons, including the fact that they are technically in open conflict with the Mexican government. So it’s a rare occasion that they offer a very public event, as we find in the case of the second annual ‘CompArte’ festival taking place within San Cristobal.
At any given time during the festival you could find slapstick tightrope clowning on topics of migration, naked theatre around gender constructs or a Zapatista Norteño band playing on one of many different stages across the site. Naturally, every aspect of the festival is free to attend; the spirit being that all are invited to participate, to share and collaborate in each other’s art. “Against capital and its walls, all of the arts” being the tagline promoted by the festival. There are children’s art workshops, giant mural paintings and collective Jarana strumming circles, with many of those presenting workshops and art from various Latin American countries and Europe.
The first five days of events are held at CIDECI, or University of the Earth, an independent university that normally hosts regular Zapatista conferences and the annual meeting of the National Indigenous Congress (CNI), an organization officially separate but inextricably linked to the Zapatista movement. At their yearly council this May, they elected Nahua indigenous healer and mother of three María de Jesús Patricio Martínez as their electoral presidential candidate for the upcoming 2018 elections. They are keen to state this not a genuine attempt to gain electoral power, rather an opportunity to challenge the electoral model itself, instead proposing a horizontal structure of organizing between communities. “We do not seek to administer power; we want to dismantle it from within … [we] want to build a new structure from below.” Many see this as an opportunity for the Zapatistas and National Indigenous Congress to nationally challenge the government that they see as the main source of oppression towards indigenous groups in Chiapas, and indeed the wider working population of Mexico.
Aside from indigenous rights struggles, there is certainly no shortage of human rights violations and current causes being advocated by the social justice movement in Mexico. During the festival many images and slogans remember the 1997 massacre in Acteal, a Zapatista village in which 45 were killed, including a number of pregnant women and their unborn children. Although officially attributed to a neighbouring village, most in Chiapas believe this to have been an act orchestrated by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) government of the time, of which all the leading figures have avoided trial after formal submissions to the high court. Another painfully ongoing campaign in Mexico is the 43 ‘disappeared’ students of Ayotzinapa, declared ‘missing’ after a student protest in 2014 with major differences between formal and external investigations about the role of official security services in the deaths. Many see this event as emblematic of the wider corruption in Mexico, in which many believe the government unofficially legitimise and support the ‘narco-trafficking’ drug barons perpetuating violence and fear across the country.
One of the rallying moments of the festival comes when the ‘Comparsa’ marching band begin their procession, complete with multiple percussionists, a full brass section, various accordions and a spectacular dance troupe. They incite a riotous brigade of dancing and singing across the site, distributing pamphlets printed with their politically charged lyrics for all to join the chanting. It seems to sum up the festival’s spirit of colourful defiance in the face of a tragic history and very present threat, where journalists are regularly murdered and activists imprisoned for public protest.
The final two days of the festival take place in Oventic, a Zapatista village in the mountains near San Cristobal, declared autonomous in 1994 as one of the five major ‘Caracols’ that make up the Zapatista regional structure in Chiapas. The atmosphere is markedly different here, presenting theatre and music produced predominantly by those from indigenous and rural Zapatista communities.
One masked Zapatista volunteer is keen to stress the international nature of the festival and the movement, stating “we are all Zapatistas, wherever you are, in whatever country you live, we are fighting for Madre Tierra against those who would seek to exploit it for their own profit”. It’s this sort of language that has often captured the attention of international anti-capitalist movements, who see the Zapatista movement as a living example of the slogan ‘another world is possible’ that came to major prominence in 2001 around the Seattle anti-globalisation protests.
It’s this same internationalism, however, that forms the basis for criticisms of the Zapatista movement. Some claim that it is now more of a media image than a movement addressing the reality of challenges faced by villages in Chiapas — a state that has become equally famous for ‘Zapatourism in which tourists can buy handcraft Zapatista souvenirs to ‘support the struggle’ for the week.
When speaking to those living in some of the more remote Zapatista villages, the daily life of ‘the struggle’ is indeed a far cry from the vibrant week of art experienced by those visiting for the duration of the festival. In May of 2017, the village of Cruzton came under attack, suffering an onslaught of bullets that lasted for hours, in which one member of the community was killed. As with Acteal, the community believe that the government initiated the attacks as a response to their non-violent declaration of autonomy. One member of the community states “they attack us because they know [the Zapatista movement] is a new dawn, that 1994 was the people waking up”. The attack received almost zero coverage outside of Zapatista channels.
Yet, there is a keen remembrance of this repression across Chiapas and, twenty four years after their initial declaration of autonomy, there still seems to be a widespread belief in the prospects of Zapatismo for a better way of life. In order to live by their ideals, the Zapatista communities have sacrificed many financial benefits that have been increasingly offered by the government in recent years (a form of bribery and co-optation as many in the communities see it).
Undoubtedly the Zapatista movement is an international symbol, which manages to draw in an impressive variety of visitors and artists for the CompArte festival. It’s a testament to how the actions of one group, in one particular region, can have such a far-reaching global impact, serving to inspire artists, thinkers and social movements internationally. This idea of international publicity seems to serve a double purpose for the Zapatistas, however, acting as a kind of defence mechanism in keeping up the awareness of rural communities that are at daily risk of attack. Communities that are still seeking to live autonomously, function with independent school systems, workers co-operatives, and communal land cultivation. The organizational systems aim to decentralize power at every opportunity, and there seems to be a deeply held belief in the community to work collectively as keepers of the land, rooted in a shared history of Maize cultivation stretching back countless generations. Seemingly simple beliefs firmly rooted in ancestral tradition, they seem to offer a “radical” and “dangerous” opposition to the idea of a global trade system reliant on unlimited access to land and labour. Seemingly simple beliefs worth sharing through the art, music and theatre that seeks to reach out internationally to those seeking the possibility of another world for all, constructed together and from below.",0

",Weinstein Co board ousts Harvey Weinstein after harassment allegations,"(Reuters) - The Weinstein Co has fired co-Chairman Harvey Weinstein, effective immediately, following reports of sexual harassment allegations against the executive, who was one of Hollywood’s biggest power brokers, the film production company said on Sunday.
The departure leaves Weinstein’s brother Bob, a co-chairman, and chief operating officer David Glasser at the helm of the company.
The board of directors made the decision “in light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days,” the company said in an emailed statement, adding that he had been notified.
A spokeswoman for the executive did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company said on Friday that Weinstein, 65, was taking an indefinite leave of absence after the New York Times reported that he had made eight settlements with women who had accused him of unwanted physical contact and sexual harassment over three decades.
Weinstein has produced or distributed Oscar-winning movies including “Shakespeare in Love” and “Chicago.” He was a prominent donor to Democrats during the 2016 general election campaign.
The company also said it was conducting its own internal investigation.

In yet another stunning display of arrogance, political correctness, and ignorance, the United Nations Human Rights Council is advising Canada to apologize for black slavery and pay reparations for their role in the slave trade and other forms of “anti-black racism.” In a report that was published this week, the special UN group said this about Canada’s current systemic racism:
“History informs anti-black racism and racial stereotypes that are so deeply entrenched in institutions, policies and practices, that its institutional and systemic forms are either functionally normalized or rendered invisible, especially to the dominant group.”
Canada, of course, did not become a self-governing country until well after Britain had banned slavery, and their participation in the Underground Railroad, helping slaves to escape the south, is well documented in the history books. But the UN’s recommendations show that there is nothing Canada or any other North American province can do to wash themselves free of culpability in the eyes of the left – which the UN most certainly is a part of. For globalist groups like this Human Rights Council, it’s better to spend time and money on the problems of the past than to focus on the serious human rights violations in North Korea, Syria, and a dozen other modern-day countries. Far better to once again blame white Westerners for evil than to shine a bright light on the shameful practices of an Islamic theocracy like Iran.
And they say Donald Trump is a divider?!
According to the UN council, the racism of slavery is reflected in contemporary Canada, where the system “replicates the historical conditions and effects of spatial segregation, economic disadvantage, and social exclusion.”
“It is important to underline that the experience of African Canadians is unique because of the particular history of anti-black racism in Canada,” the report says. It recommends that the Canadian government “take concrete steps to preserve the history of enslavement and the political, social and economic contributions of African Canadians by establishing monuments in their honour.”
Seriously, though: How many years before we just…move on? A thousand? A thousand thousand? At some point, we all have to get on with our lives, no? No black Westerner alive today was ever in chains. No black Westerner has a parent that was ever enslaved. We’re talking about the sins of an entirely different generation in an entirely different century in what might as well have been an entirely different world. These are not the problems of the present, they are substitutes for the problems of the present. We dare say, in many cases, they are excuses for the problems of the present.
We are not free of problems in the year 2017. We would do well to address OUR generation’s problems and leave yesterday’s where they belong.

Since then, conspiracy theories and images have repeatedly emerged to prove that the rapper is still alive. Now the man who was sitting in the car with Tupac, when the shots were fired, speaks out and makes for the most bizarre story of the year!
 
In an interview with the American TV station ""Fox"", music mogul Suge explains that he is in life imprisonment for murder and cannot explain why his former best friend should not live anymore.
 
SUGE KNIGHT INTERVIEW:
 
 
""When I left this hospital, Pac and I were laughing and making jokes. I can't understand how someone's state of health can change from so good to so bad.""
 
When asked if he believes the rapper is still alive, Suge replies,""I tell you, you never know with Pac.""
 
FURTHER PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE IN DEATH
 
Incidentally, the music mogul is not alone in his opinion that Tupac Shakur could still be alive. A former policeman recently claimed that he had been paid 1.3 million euros to fake Tupac's death. The official put the following words on record:
 
""The world needs to know what I've done. I'm ashamed to have exchanged my honesty for money and I can't die without the world knowing it ""
 
Below we have included the most popular stories about Tupac!

The Giants break out at home behind Chris Stratton and shut out the Padres for their 63rd win. The worst the team can do now is lose 99 games. They won’t repeat the ignominy of 1985′s 100-loss season. It’s a small comfort in a wretched campaign but it is something. I’m happy. It’s the one thing I was clinging to, and it came to pass. The Giants get their fifth team shutout. The nice thing about tonight’s win is that is takes the pressure off Matt Cain tomorrow. He’ll likely be on a short leash anyway so now the only thing that matters is the fans getting their sentimental send-off.
Nick Hundley was this year’s Willie Mac Award recipient. He seems to have made a great impression on the organization and I expect they will push hard to re-sign him. I thought Jeff Samardzija deserved consideration–he never missed his turn in the rotation and was one of only eight pitchers in baseball to log 200 innings. But Hundley, despite a .272 OBA, was a worthy awardee with his timely slugging (23 doubles, 9 homers) and solid work backing up Buster.
Go Giants!

http://www.disclose.tv/news/strange_domelike_formations_found_on_mars/140438,Strange Dome-Like Formations Found On Mars,"Joseph Levy, a research associate at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, and his team have recently made some incredible discoveries about Mars that could provide proof that there is life on the red planet.
 
“We were drawn to this site because it looked like it could host some of the key ingredients for habitability — water, heat and nutrients, ” Joseph Levy explained. The site they are most interested in is a strangely shaped depression that was probably formed by a volcano beneath a glacier. This is an exciting discovery because researchers now believe it could have been a warm, chemical-rich environment - exactly what is needed for lifeforms to evolve.

what are these v-shaped formations doing on Mars?
NASA Flys by Enceladus and Finds Mysterious Formations. What are these things?
 
The site is inside a crater perched on the rim of the Hellas basin in an area surrounded by ancient glacial deposits. Levy first thought it might be significant in 2009 when he noticed it contained crack-like features in several photographs. He realized that they resembled so called ""ice cauldrons"" on Earth, which are often found in Iceland and Greenland. These ice cauldrons occur when a volcano erupts underneath an ice sheet. Photos also reveal another depression in the Galaxias Fossae region of Mars had a similar appearance.
 
<img src=""http://sciencevibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Mars-768x445.jpg"">
 
“These landforms caught our eye because they’re weird looking. They’re concentrically fractured, so they look like a bulls-eye. That can be a very diagnostic pattern you see in Earth materials, ” said Levy, who first observed the photos when he was a postdoctoral researcher at Portland State University.”The big contribution of the study was that we were able to measure not just their shape and appearance, but also how much material was lost to form the depressions. That 3-D view lets us test this idea of volcanic or impact, ” Levy said.”That surprised us and led to a lot of thinking about whether it meant there was melting concentrated in the center that removed ice and allowed stuff to pour in from the sides. Or if you had an impact crater, did you start with a much smaller crater in the past, and by sublimating away ice, you’ve expanded the apparent size of the crater, ” Levy said.
 
Here is an example of a similar ice cauldron on Earth:
 
<img src=""https://news.utexas.edu/sites/news.utexas.edu/files/ice_cauldron.jpg"">
 
However, after running simulations of formation scenarios fro the two depressions, researchers concluded that they probably formed in different ways. The debris in the area around the Galaxias Fossae depression suggests that it was the result of an impact from an asteroid, although the volcanic history of the area means that volcanic origins should not be ruled out.
 
In contrast, the Hellas depression shows a significant number of signs of volcanic origins. It lacks the surrounding debris that would be caused by an impact, and has a fracture pattern associated with concentrated removal of ice by melting or sublimation under the surface, which could only be cause by a great heat source.
 
Ice cauldrons have been formed on Earth before, as shown in this video:
 
 
The reason this discovery is so interesting is that the interaction of lava and ice would have created an environment with liquid water and chemical nutrients, which are both required ingredients for life as it is known on Earth. Levy explained that the Hellas depression and, to a lesser extent, the Galaxias Fossae depression, should be places of special interest as scientists and amateurs alike continue to look for habitats, and life, on Mars.
 
Gro Pedersen, a volcanologist at the University of Iceland who was not involved with the study, agreed that these sites are a major find and that they are likely to lead to more discoveries in the future.
 
“These features do really resemble ice cauldrons known from Earth, and just from that perspective they should be of great interest, ” Pedersen said. “Both because their existence may provide information on the properties of subsurface material — the potential existence of ice — and because of the potential for revealing ice-volcano interactions.”
 
Hopefully, in the near future, the truth will come forth about what might be under all of that ice. It certainly seems that the possibility of life on Mars is quite real.

Citing calculations from members of the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Comptroller General, O Globo said the fine is a condition for the signature of a leniency agreement that would allow the firm to continue bidding for government contracts.
Andrade Gutierrez is one of 10 companies being investigated since March 2015 for the “Car Wash Operation,” a probe into kickbacks from company executives to politicians in return for contracts at state-run enterprises, especially Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA).
Andrade is in talks to negotiate the terms of the leniency agreement, but the firm considered the settlement amount too high and likely to lead it to bankruptcy, O Globo reported, citing unnamed sources with knowledge of the negotiations.
Andrade Gutierrez did not immediately reply to emails and calls seeking comment.

For the United States, it was one of the biggest attacks to ever occur on America soil.
 
The coming down of the twin towers of the World Trade Center was something that sent shock waves through the masses, as the two once large towering structures laid in a large heap of rubble. The tragedy was tremendous, and over three thousand innocent individuals lost their lives on this one day.
 
But as the dust settled around the area that was now known as ground zero, symbols of hope and perhaps forgiveness was found among the rubble.
 
Bible found in Ground Zero Rubble
 
 
The American flag that once stood high on a pole was now leaning but still standing, not knocked down, a symbol that the flag still stood strong and so would the nation. For those who are of spiritual belief, there were signs that God hadn't abandoned us. Two large cross beams were now forming a distinctive cross near the still standing American flag.
 
These two symbols of hope and recovery were found early, but another symbol would also be found as the rubble began to be cleared away. Fund among the rubble was a bible that had been somewhat burned and melted, but this wasn't the most unusual part of the discovery, it was the page that the now milted bibles were turned to and now remains on. There clear as day was a verse from Revelation which was taken from Christ sermon on the mount that read:
 
“Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.”
 
To believers, this was a clear message that despite what had happened we have to find it in our hearts to forgive our enemies if only to help ourselves to heal. The firefighter who recovered the bible in 2003 turned it over to those preserving those things of historical significance documenting September 11th.
 
The melted remains of the Bible found on that fateful day is now part of Ground Zero Museum that is now opened on the spot where the twin towers used to be, and the new FreedomTower now stands along as a memorial to those who lost their lives that day. As for this being a message or not, ponder this. There are many verses of the bible and several in the book of Revelation alone. But this the verse that was recovered. But even if forgiveness is possible, no one will ever forget what happened on 9/11 and no one ever should not even future generations.

After a win in week three, the Jets welcomed the Jacksonville Jaguars (2-1) in an attempt to go .500 for the season. RB Bilal Powell started in place of an injured Matt Forte. On a day when Kevin Mawae was inducted into the Ring of Honor, here is the good, the bad and the ugly…
THE GOOD
For the first time this season, the offense got off to a good start. First quarter totals included 4 first downs, 131 total yards and 0 turnovers.
QB Josh McCown was 10/11 for 95 yards in the first half and 22/31 for 224 overall.
Bilal Powell scored on a 75-yard TD run which was the second longest in team history. Powell had 113 yards at the half and a career-high 21 carries for 163 in the game.
RB Elijah McGuire had a 69-yard touchdown run.
WR Robby Anderson led all receivers with 59 yards and a long of 41.
Special teams successfully pulled off a fake punt near the end of the first half.
DE Kony Ealy intercepted a pass from QB Blake Bortles which led to a K Chandler Catanzaro 26-yard field goal.
Catanzaro kicked a game-winning 41-yard field goal.
THE BAD
A costly delay-of-game penalty pushed back a Catanzaro field goal attempt which he missed from 45-yards out.
The defense gave up 145 total yards to RB Leonard Fournette.
THE UGLY
The offensive line gave up costly first-half sacks.
A backwards pass from McCown to Powell was picked up by Jacksonville’s Myles Jack and returned 81-yards for a touchdown.
Jets inactive players included: TE Will Tye, TE Jordan Leggett, OLB Josh Martin, QB Christian Hackenberg, RB Matt Forte, CB Derrick Jones, T Brandon Shell

http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/04/health/tantrums-parenting-how-to-deal-with-them/index.html,"Ah! My kid is having a tantrum, and I want to scream","(CNN) Most parents have experienced it: that moment when their son or daughter has a full-blown temper tantrum, which may involve screaming, crying, stomping their feet, dropping to the floor or all of the above.
Of course, this is stressful no matter where it happens, but when it's in a public place and you feel as if everyone is looking at you and thinking ""What kind of parent can't control his or her kid?"" you may want to curl up in a ball and start screaming yourself.
But you know that won't really be productive, so what can you do?
For some answers, we turned the camera on kids themselves: a group of New Jersey fifth- and sixth-graders, many of whom admitted having tantrums at one time or another.
Grace Szostak, who just started middle school, says she had them until the third grade and could be found banging on the doors in her room.
""It was not good,"" she conceded.
As part of a new video series, ""If I Were a Parent,"" showcasing kids taking on modern-day parenting problems, I asked Grace and her classmates what they would do if their son or daughter had a tantrum.
""I'd say 'cool down, cool down,' and I'd sit with them and talk to them about it,"" said Lance Jenkins, who is in the sixth grade.
And if they don't calm down? ""That's the hard part,"" he admitted.
Casey Wescott, who's also in the sixth grade, said parents are sometimes quick to just react and may not take the time to figure out why their children are crying. ""Try to slow down a little more and ... ask your kids what is wrong,"" he said.
Fiona Laddey, a fifth-grader, said it's important for parents to stay calm, ""because if you start yelling, it would be even more chaos.""
Family therapist Tricia Ferrara is author of ""Parenting 2.0.""
Tricia Ferrara , a licensed family therapist and parenting strategist who has been in private practice in the Philadelphia area for more than a decade, agrees.
Ferrara, author of ""Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,"" said that while it may be hard to do, we need to forget about the other people who may be watching us during those cringe-inducing moments when our children are in the throes of a tantrum.
""I always say to parents ... you've got to stop, drop and do what you have to do,"" Ferrara said during a previous interview. ""Escalating back to the child is not helping anything, because that's more sensory information that is going to make them go nuclear.""
Think of yourself as a ""tuning fork,"" she said. ""The calmer and clearer you can be, the better things will go.""
Adults should look for creative ways to maintain authority and realize that eliciting even small concessions from a child can go a long way, Ferrara said. ""Create one bit of upside, even if it's 'you take one breath and we count to three together, (and then) we can get you what you want, and then we'll go home,' "" she explained. ""What that does is, it keeps you in control and as the authority in the situation.""
The biggest mistake parents can make?
Totally giving in to the tantrum is never a good way to go, experts say, and children themselves seem to understand why that's not a good plan.
""That teaches them, 'Oh, my parents give in, so I can throw more tantrums and get everything I want,' "" said Toniann Garruto, a fifth-grader.
A child might think, ""Oh, I can throw a temper tantrum, and I can get a cookie if I stop, so I'm going to throw a temper tantrum five seconds later and then stop,"" said Sean Wescott, who's in middle school.
Casey, Sean's twin brother, added, ""If you give in, that's going to occur more and more, and you don't want that to happen.""
Too many parents (this mother included) don't realize that there are things you can do to prevent a meltdown, Ferrara said.
When kids are tired and hungry, they can't tell you what's going on, so it's probably best to avoid errands at the end of the day, when it's harder for kids to coordinate their emotions with their bodies, she said. (I joked in a previous story how I wished I had this information when my kids were little. Had I know then what I know now, I probably wouldn't have taken them grocery shopping right before dinner time!)
The ""biggest mistake"" parents make is going into situations ""without a strategy,"" Ferrara said. ""Do you go to the hairdresser without a plan? A business meeting? Go buy a car? No, but we always allow ourselves to fall into these potholes with our kids with no plan,"" she said.
If your child tends to have tantrums if they don't get what they want, you can tell them that how they behave is going to determine whether they are going to get to do something later, such as play with birthday presents or have a play date with friends.

And during an outing, if your child starts to behave in a way that is unacceptable, instead of getting into a verbal joust with them, you can say, "" 'Do you want to play with your birthday presents?' You can remain clear and calm and communicate in a way"" that they understand, Ferrara said.

It was officially said that Harvey Oswald, a former marine had been the one who pulled the trigger and killed the president; however, this has been disputed by many.
 
All Documents Relating To Assassination Should Be Revealed By 26 October 2017
 
All of the documents for all of the entities of the government have been required by the Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act 1992 to be revealed to the public on 26 October 2017. However, the volume of documents with the name of “volume 5” might not get released and history will repeat itself.
 
In July 3,810 documents belonging to the FBI and CIA about the assassination from the Assassination Records Review Board put out some revelations that researchers of the assassination had eaten up and publicized. An example from the documents was that Earle Cabell was the mayor of Dallas at the time of the assassination and he was an asset of the CIA during the 1950s and brother Charles Cabell had been a CIA high-ranking official until 1962.

Is Missing Volume A Clerical Error Or Deliberate Concealment?
 
This release was anticipated by many people who have been looking for answers but thanks to either a clerical error that has been timed conveniently or deliberate hiding, one whole volume of documents might never be released to the public.
 
Langley Air Force Base is the headquarters of the CIA, and it has an office with the name of Office of Security. This is the place where archives that are top secret are stored, and these are called the Office of Security Archival Holdings. This is a different archive from the one that is frequently used which is found in Alexandria VA and called the Agency Archival Record Center.
 
There Were 7-Volumes In 1977, When Checked By Russ Holmes
 
The whole 7-volume collection of the documents had been intact in 1977 and it was checked out by Russ Holmes, and it was said that the whole 7-volumes had been in the Office of General Counsel at that time. However, when the CIA was asked to turn over all of the documents on Lee Harvey Oswald, who was said to have been the one who pulled the trigger to kill the president, the agency stonewalled said investigator Malcolm Blunt.
 
Blunt said that a big search by the CIA did not find the security files about Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination Records Review Board were not told about their existence. It was not until 1997 when a staff member of the ARRB came across evidence that two investigations by Congress had gained access to the files that the CIA managed to find the files.
 
In 1998 Volume 5 Was Missing
 
The 7-volume set was eventually received by the AARB in 1998; however, staff members found that volume 5 out of the 7 set was in fact missing. The agency said that perhaps volume 5 had been put together with volume 4 or 6. The agency came to the conclusion that there might not ever have been a volume 5 in the security files on Lee Harvey Oswald and in fact there were only 6 volumes.
 
2017 has been the year that many conspiracy theorists have been waiting for as this was the year when the files on Lee Harvey Oswald might shed some light on the assassination. The Citizens against Political Assassinations is one group that has been waiting to get hold of the documents, including volume 5. They are of the belief that the narrative of the government is full of holes and it is something that needs to be looked into. A lot of the members of the group are lawyers, and many want to clear the name of Lee Harvey Oswald of any wrongdoing as they believe he was a scapegoat.
 
<img src=""http://hnn.us/sites/default/files/153981-image-spysguideoswaldassassincostume.jpg"">
 
Lawrence Schnapf, Chair of the Environmental Law Section of the New York Bar Association has voiced many comments about the current president along with the relationship he has with the Deep State that has the media on fire with talk of perhaps another political assassination.
 
The Warren Commission Called The Original Fake News Organization
 
Schnapf is on the CAPA legal committee, and he made a comparison of the early 1960s to the present day after a discussion on why the assassination of JFK is still relevant today. He called the Warren Commission the original fake news organization. The Warren Commission became the official narrative of the government. The commission had refused to look into information that was said to be exculpatory and which has been hidden in government secrecy. Schnapf said that he hopes this is going to come out this year to comply with the JFK Assassination Records Act.
 
The group wants to use the shell casings that were found at the scene and ballistics analyses in the 21st century to find out if Oswald killed JFK or not. Schnapf said that the group would conduct a mock trial in November and then, later on, would go into a legal proceeding with the name of a Court of Inquiry, which would be a court proceeding that was official to prove that Oswald was not the one who shot Kennedy. They want to expunge the name of Oswald from the narrative and clear not only his name but that of his daughter. He concluded that “Oswald was not convictable, much less indictable”.
 
The lawyers of the group have maintained that the mainstream media overlooked the real assassination story, the government is not transparent, and the Department of Justice has been politicized, including the FBI.

Mandatory Credit: Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports
(The Sports Xchange) - The Boston Red Sox fired manager John Farrell on Wednesday, two days after his team was eliminated from the playoffs.
Farrell, who managed the Red Sox since 2013, will not return for the 2018 season, president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski announcement. The team said a search for a new manager will begin immediately.
Farrell, 55, was 432-378 (.533) in five seasons, leading the Red Sox to the World Series title in 2013. He was under contract through the end of the 2018 season.
The Red Sox were eliminated from the playoffs on Monday, losing to the Houston Astros 5-4 in Game 4 of the American League Division Series.
Boston finished 93-69 (.574) in 2017 to win its ninth AL East division title. The Red Sox had the third-best record in the American League, tied for fifth best in the majors.
During his Red Sox tenure, Farrell’s teams won three division titles (2013, 2016, 2017). His 432 managerial wins and 810 games managed both rank sixth in club history, and he is the only manager ever to lead the Red Sox to consecutive division titles.
Farrell’s first season in 2013 was highlighted by Boston’s eighth World Series championship.
Farrell began his major league managerial career with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2011, leading the team to a 154-170 record over two seasons. In his seven full seasons as a manager, his clubs went 586-548 (.517).
Farrell’s first professional coaching stint began with Boston in 2007 when he spent four seasons as pitching coach. Over that four-year span, the Red Sox had three postseason appearances (2007-09), including the 2007 World Series title.",1
http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/family-friends-mourn-loss-loved-shooting-50296861,'Too good for this world': Las Vegas victims mourned,"Some died with loved ones, some with friends. Others were with ""framily"" — friends they considered family — when they were shot and killed.
All shared the terror caused by a gunman spraying bullets into a crowd of concertgoers from a high-rise hotel in Las Vegas, ending a day of dancing and smiles with bloody horror.
Here are stories about some of the 58 people who didn't make it out alive.
LIFE OF 'GENTLE SPIRIT' REVOLVED AROUND MUSIC
Victor Link was doing one of the things he most enjoyed with the person he most enjoyed being with — his fiancee, Lynne Gonzales — when automatic gunfire peppered a huge crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas.
Link, 55, Gonzales, and two of their close friends were there to hear country music when he was shot.
A ""gentle spirit"" was lost with Link's death, said his older brother, Craig Link, 58.
""He was somebody that everybody loved,"" Craig Link told The Associated Press on Thursday. ""Victor had a gentle spirit, a loving spirit. He was giver. He was always there for any of his friends or family. If he could, he would help out wherever he could. He was a good man.
""He was my younger brother, but I always aspired to be him.""
The brothers grew up northwest of Bakersfield in Shafter, California. As teens, much of their young lives revolved around music, going to concerts and cars.
Victor Link and Gonzales, who wasn't hurt in Sunday's shooting, had been to several country music concerts over the last several years. Going to concerts ""was their favorite thing to do,"" Craig Link said.
""He was so blessed to have Lynne in his life,"" Craig Link said. ""Those two had an amazing love that very, very few people are blessed to understand and enjoy.""
In addition to Craig Link and Gonzales, Victor Link is survived by a son, Christian; his father, Loyd; another brother, Vincent; and a sister, Lisa Link Hiestand.
DISNEY WORKERS AMONG VICTIMS IN SHOOTING
Carrie Barnette, 34, was a Disneyland food service worker who never lost her sense of wonder for things like hummingbirds, according to her friends and family.
Barnette, of Riverside, California, was part of the culinary team at Disney California Adventure for 10 years.
Disney Chairman and CEO Robert Iger said in a statement that she was ""beloved by her friends and colleagues.""
""We are especially heartbroken over the loss of one of our own to this unconscionable and senseless act,"" Iger said. Another Disney cast member, Jessica Milam, was seriously injured in the mass shooting at the country music festival in Las Vegas over the weekend.
Joey Castillo, who is married to Barnette's younger sister, told the Orange County Register that Barnette loved hummingbirds because she saw them as a sign that her belated grandparents were watching over them.
""She was always happy and loved her grandparents with who she's now with up in heaven,"" he said. ""She will be greatly missed.""
'FRAMILY' GROUP MISSING A MEMBER
Nicol Kimura, 38, went to the festival with a group of seven men and women who call themselves ""framily"" — friends who are like family. She was fatally shot seconds after the gunfire began, said Ryan Miller, a businessman and pastor who is part of the group.
A Southern California native who lived in Placentia, Kimura's survivors include her parents, a sister and the friends who were with her when she died. She was single and didn't have children, but she was treated like family by the kids of group members, Miller said.
""She was a mom to all of our kids; they called her 'auntie,'"" he said. ""I have two kids myself, and they were just absolutely devastated that they will not be able to see her again.""
Kimura worked in a tax office for Orange County and spent most weekends with her friends. No one else in the group was shot.
""She was just such an amazing woman and she was just such a light,"" he said.
HE WAS 'TOO GOOD FOR THIS WORLD'
Brian Fraser, a father of four, was moving toward the stage in anticipation of Jason Aldean playing his favorite song, ""Dirt Road Anthem,"" when gunshots rang out.
While others around him ducked for safety, Fraser looked around to try to spot where the shots were coming from, so that he could shield his wife. He died doing just that, his son, Nick Arellano, said.
Fraser's friend ushered their wives and friends to safety before rushing back to perform CPR on Fraser. A doctor and several nurses in the crowd came to help, eventually loading Fraser into a wheelbarrow and taking him to paramedics.
Arellano recounted the story as told to him by his wife, his mother, and family friends. Arellano had been at the concert with them for the prior two days, but chose to head home early, just missing the harrowing scene.
Arellano described Fraser, 39, as ""the definition of American,"" a man who boated, hunted, fished and snowboarded. Fraser married his wife, Stephanie, 11 years ago, adopting Arellano and one of her other children.
The couple had two more children together, now ages 4 and 10. The family lives in La Palma, California.
""He taught me what it meant to be an honest, motivated, driven, loving man to not only family and friends, but even to just strangers, or anyone he came in contact with — just to be a human being to everyone on this planet,"" Arellano said.
MOM WAS ENJOYING WEEKEND AWAY WITH GIRLFRIENDS
A few hours before the shooting, Lisa Patterson called her husband to tell him what a great time she was having with her girlfriends — one of the rare weekends she was not coaching one of her kids' softball teams or volunteering at a school or church event.
Her husband, Bob Patterson, told his wife, a country music lover, to enjoy herself and stay for the last band, assuring her he could get their kids off to school the next morning.
It was the last time Bob Patterson spoke to his wife. After news broke of the shooting spree, he spent the night calling hospitals trying to find her. By 6 a.m. Monday, he and his 16-year-old son, Robert, jumped in the car and drove three hours from their Los Angeles suburb to Las Vegas to find her. His 19-year-old daughter, Amber, drove over from Arizona.
They spent 10 hours searching. Late Monday, Bob Patterson was approached by an official at the Las Vegas convention center, where the coroner's office set up operations to have more space where families could come to identify those who died.
""My children who had been waiting 100 feet outside the room, knew when I came back out that she had died by the look on my face,"" he said. ""My oldest daughter instantly broke down and fell on the ground crying.""
Patterson was given his wife's blood-stained purse, her cellphone and wrist band she wore to get into festival, but little information.
""I have not been told yet how she died,"" said Patterson on Wednesday as he planned a funeral for his 46-year-old wife in their home town of Lomita next Friday at their Catholic church.
After he and his children headed home to Lomita, he told his 8-year-old daughter, Brooke, that ""mommy passed away.""
He said since she is so young, she seems to be taking it the best out of all of them.
Bob Patterson met his wife when she was 18 and immediately was taken by her beauty, he said. They dated for seven years and were married for 21 years. They opened a hardware flooring store together. They were always together, he said, whether it was running their business, helping at their church, volunteering at school or coaching the many sports their kids did.
""My wife loved life, loved helping and there is nothing she would not do to help someone,"" he said.
FRIENDS DIED AT CONCERT TOGETHER
Austin Davis, 29, and his parents had a bond ""unlike anything I've ever witnessed,"" Davis's friend Katelyn Hood wrote in an online fundraising post.
He was their only son. As soon as news came that he may have been shot, they headed straight from their home in Riverside, California, to Las Vegas. They waited for 20 hours before learning that he had been killed, Hood wrote.
""They raised the best son,"" Hood wrote. ""He worked so very hard and took the most pride in that and anything he did.""
Through Hood, Davis's parents declined to be interviewed.
Davis also leaves behind his girlfriend of nine years, whom he met in high school. He was at the concert with his family friend, Thomas Day Jr., who also died.
A SEARCH FOR MOM, AND THEN HORROR
Laura Shipp raised her son Corey by herself, then moved to Las Vegas from Thousand Oaks, California, a few years ago to be closer to him. Both were country music fans, and they went to the Route 91 Harvest Festival together, said Laura Shipp's mother, Joyce Shipp.
They were together until just before a gunman opened fire Sunday night.
""We really don't know what happened, just that she went to the bathroom and nobody saw her after that,"" Joyce Shipp said of her 50-year-old daughter, a dispatcher at an air conditioner company.
After her son, a Marine Corps reservist, spent more than a day trying to find out what had happened to Shipp, he was notified she was dead.
""He's not doing great,"" Joyce Shipp said of her grandson. ""He's just trying to get his arms around all this but he's surrounded by his friends and family. We don't want to leave him alone at this time.""
MAN DIED IN BOYFRIEND'S ARMS
Cameron Robinson, 28, had been looking forward to attending the festival with his boyfriend for days, said friend and colleague Brad Jerbic.
Robinson was a records specialist for the city of Las Vegas, and his infectious personality made him the heart of the office, Jerbic, the city attorney, said Tuesday. Robinson had moved to southern Utah about a year ago to be with boyfriend Bobby Eardley, and commuted two hours each way to work every day.
""He was just so happy — you could see it in his face,"" Jerbic said. ""If he was alive, he would say this is the best time of his life.""
The couple was together when Robinson was shot in the neck and bled to death, Jerbic said. Eardley was also struck by shrapnel and suffered minor injuries.
""(Eardley) actually held him. He was with him when he died. He tried to stop the bleeding. There was so much chaos,"" Jerbic said.
YOUNGEST OF FOUR WANTED TO HELP OTHERS
Victim Michelle Vo, 32, was the youngest of four siblings in a family from the San Francisco Bay Area.
She worked hard at her job at New York Life insurance group in Pasadena, California, loved to cheer for the Golden State Warriors and was a pretty good golfer, said sister Cathy Vo Warren.
Warren remembered her sister as someone who always wanted to do good for those around her. ""You'd need a poet to tell you everything,"" said Cathy's husband, Paul Warren.
Born in Southern California, Vo was attending the Las Vegas concert by herself and befriended Kody Robertson. The two were together when Vo was shot. Robertson later helped relatives find her.
""We're very thankful that we met Kody,"" Warren said. ""We're very thankful for him to be there with Michelle so that she wasn't alone in her last moments.""
FESTIVAL GUARD DIED HELPING OTHERS
Erick Silva, 21, was working as a private security guard at the music festival when he was killed while trying to help people get out of the venue safely.
His close friend, Martin Adrian Marin Jr., said he was not surprised Silva died helping others. ""He would give the shirt off his back to comfort anyone,"" Marin said. ""He was such a courageous man.""
Marin has saved the last text message Silva sent to him that Sunday morning, before going to work at the festival.
""I want to wish you a lovely and productive day,"" Silva texted. ""Just know that I am always here.""
Silva would send text messages like that almost daily, Marin said.
""He was always so sweet and generous and caring,"" he said. ""It was not hard to fall in love with his personality.""
FATHER OF SIX KNOWN FOR BIG HEART, PERSONALITY
John Phippen was a father of six who was always willing to lend an ear — or a cold beer — to a friend in need.
""He had a heart that was larger than life and a personality to match,"" neighbor Leah Nagyivanyi wrote on an online fundraising page. ""You felt like you knew him for years the first time you met him.""
Nagyivanyi is raising money through GoFundMe to help Phippen's children pay for his funeral.
Phippen, 56, lived in Santa Clarita, California. The youngest of his six children, a daughter, is just 14.
SPORTS FAN DIED SHIELDING FRIEND'S WIFE
Chris Hazencomb, 44, of Camarillo, California, was a big sports fan. His mother, Maryanne Hazencomb, told the Ventura County Star she had him taken off a ventilator at 10:50 a.m. Monday.
Hazencomb was struck in the head while shielding his best friend's wife from bullets, his mother said.
He loved watching professional wrestling on TV every Monday night ""even though it's phony,"" Maryanne Hazencomb told the newspaper. He also loved football and followed the Los Angeles Rams.
Hazencomb was a graduate of Thousand Oaks High School.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/02/us/las-vegas-attack-stephen-paddock-trnd/index.html,Stephen Paddock: What we know about the Las Vegas gunman,"(CNN) The last time Eric Paddock heard from his brother, Stephen Paddock had texted to find out how their 90-year-old mother was doing.
It was mid-September and Hurricane Irma had cut power in the Orlando, Florida, neighborhood where she lived. Stephen Paddock, who lived in Nevada, followed up with a call to their mother. Later, he sent her a walker to help her get around, Eric Paddock said.
About two weeks after the text, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock would be dead of a self-inflicted gunshot after police say he opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas.
He was 'just a guy'
The news doesn't square with Eric Paddock's image of his older brother, he told reporters Monday -- a poker-playing accountant and real estate investor with no apparent political or religious affiliation, ""as far as I know,"" he hastened to add.
To his brother, Stephen was ""just a guy,"" an ""army of one"" with no known children despite a string of relationships. Someone you might see nursing a drink alone at a bar. Someone who went on cruises and played $100-a-hand video poker. Someone who sent boxes of cookies to his mother.
""There's absolutely no way I could conceive that my brother would shoot a bunch of people that he didn't know,"" Eric Paddock said outside his home Monday, shaking his head as he fumbled for words.
""Something just incredibly wrong happened to my brother.""

Deadliest mass shooting in modern US history
Various agencies are investigating what led Stephen Paddock to shoot from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel into a crowd of some 22,000 concertgoers. Paddock killed more than 58 people and wounded nearly 500.
Las Vegas police said they did not know Stephen Paddock's name before the shooting and they believe he acted alone. He bought multiple firearms in the past, but investigators believe the firearms were purchased legally , a law enforcement official said. A Mesquite store, Guns & Guitars, said it sold a gun to Paddock and that ""he never gave any indication or reason to believe he was unstable or unfit at any time.""
Police found at least 23 weapons inside his hotel room, including multiple rifles, some with scopes. At least one rifle may have been altered to function as an automatic weapon, a law enforcement official said.

'We're up all night because we gamble'
Eric Paddock said he knew his brother had firearms. His children had gone skeet-shooting with their uncle before, but Eric did not know Stephen to be a hunter.
Eric helped his brother drive across the country in 2016 to a new home in Mesquite, Nevada, a retiree community about 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas. Along the way, the brothers ate sushi and drank late into the evening, Eric Paddock recalled. But he did not recall his brother bringing a machine gun along with him.
However, he acknowledged the limits of his knowledge, living thousands of miles from a brother he only spoke to occasionally.
Stephen Paddock lived in Mesquite with his girlfriend, 62-year-old Marilou Danley. She was out of the country during the shooting, but returned Tuesday and was questioned by law enforcement.
He might have kept quiet about the guns, but he wasn't shy about the gambling.
When he bought a house in Mesquite, he wrote on his application that his income came from ""gambling."" He also told a real estate agent that he gambled about $1 million a year , an agent speaking on condition of anonymity said.
He sought privacy and kept a low profile. Some of his neighbors rarely saw him, but they knew he was a gambler.
Paddock said he was a high roller and real estate speculator from Las Vegas. ""We're up all night because we gamble,"" Don Judy, one of Paddock's old neighbors in Florida, remembered him saying.

A search of Stephen Paddock's home in Mesquite turned up at least 19 additional firearms, explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Monday night. Several pounds of ammonium nitrate, a material used to make explosives, were found in Paddock's car.
That came as a surprise to one of his former neighbors. ""If there was any impression, I would say, guy had no idea what a gun was,"" said Judy, who lived next door to Stephen Paddock from 2013-2015 in a retirement community in Melbourne, Florida.
Paddock never stayed at the house for very long, Judy said. Sometimes he came with his girlfriend, sometimes without.
Not a team player
Stephen Paddock held various federal jobs in the 1970s and 80s. He was a US Postal Service letter carrier in the mid- to -late 70s; an agent with the Internal Revenue Service from 1978 to 1984; and worked for the Defense Contract Audit Agency in 1984 and 1985, the US Office of Personnel Management said.
Eric Paddock said his brother also was a successful real estate investor who owned apartments and houses. Records link him over the years to more than nine houses, condos and apartment buildings in Nevada, Florida and California.
Investigators were looking Monday at several properties in the Reno area associated with Stephen Paddock.
Residents of the properties told CNN the FBI stopped by on Monday. One resident at a residence on Del Webb Parkway said he and his wife never saw Stephen Paddock, but saw his girlfriend as recently as this summer.

Because he had no children, he was free to come and go as he pleased, his brother said. Paddock had married and divorced twice, court records show. His first marriage lasted two years, from 1977 to 1979. He remarried in 1985, and divorced again in 1990 after nearly five years of marriage.
His second ex-wife lives in Los Angeles County, California, and has had no contact with him in years, authorities said.
He flew planes for a while until he got tired of it and started taking cruises, his brother said. A federal official confirmed he had a pilot's license, but said that he was not up to date on the medical certification he would need in order to fly legally.
It was a passion that traced back to his childhood, his brother said. He excelled at sports, too, but never played or joined organized clubs. ""He wasn't a team kind of guy,"" Eric Paddock said.
Father was bank robber
One point of intrigue has emerged from the shooter's background, courtesy of his brother: Their father was a bank robber.
Benjamin Hoskins Paddock
According to the FBI, Benjamin Hoskins Paddock was on its most-wanted list from June 10, 1969 until May 5, 1977. He escaped from prison in 1969 and lived on the run until 1978, when he was arrested in Oregon, the Eugene Register-Guard reported at the time. Eric Paddock said his father died a few years ago and that ""he was never with my mom."" Eric said he was born while his father was on the run.
But Eric Paddock resisted the idea that his brother was somehow emulating their father's criminal tendencies. When pressed to explain what happened, he has no explanation.
""He was my brother, and it's like an asteroid fell out of the sky,"" he said. ""We're still just completely dumbstruck.""
Correction: This story has been revised to give the correct full name of the Eugene Register-Guard. The story also has been revised to give the correct amount of time Stephen Paddock and his ex-wife were married. They were married for four years and nine months.",1

","Over $971,000 spent on non-commercial air travel for Obama administration Interior secretaries","Story highlights The figures come from an Interior Department report given to a congressional panel
Non-commercial travel for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has so far cost $72,849
(CNN) Just over $971,000 was spent on non-commercial travel for interior secretaries in the Obama administration during a seven-year period, according to records obtained by CNN.
That would include travel on both chartered planes as well as on Interior Department aircraft.
The Interior Department submitted records detailing the non-commercial travel of former secretaries Ken Salazar and Sally Jewell to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, saying $971,634 was spent on 81 trips. It came as part of a request to various Cabinet departments for their non-commercial travel records following recent controversy over Cabinet secretaries' travel.
The non-commercial travel for current Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has so far cost $72,849 on six trips since he took office in March.
Forty-eight trips by Salazar between 2010 and 2012 cost $586,196. Salazar was the Obama administration's first interior secretary.

For those keeping an eye on the early overseas game this week as an indicator for whether privileged multimillionaire athletes will continue to protest the flag, the national anthem, and President Trump, the Miami Dolphins have featured the day’s first kneelers. Prior to the 9:30 ET kickoff of the NFL’s showcase game in London, three members of the Dolphins took the knee during the Star-Spangled Banner although all stood for a rousing rendition of “God Save the Queen”, an interesting contradiction in light of the British Empire’s history of unbearable cruelty toward blacks in the colonial era.

(Before It's News)

By Rich Mitchell
President Donald Trump on Thursday waived shipping regulations for ships bound for Puerto Rico after political pressure forced his hand. It won’t help.
Hundreds of containers and semi-trailers are stacked at the port in San Juan, Puerto Rico that contain food, water, medical supplies and other needed goods. But because many roads are impassable and there is a shortage of truck drivers and trucks, none of the goods are leaving the port.
The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also called the Jones Act, requires that all goods traveling between U.S. ports be carried by ships made, flagged and operated by U.S. entities. Waiving the restrictions will allow more ships to bring more cargo to a port that is unable to distribute it.
The move is political as it comes with no cost to the President and avoids him being painted as holding things up. Other than optics, it’s a useless move.
The real problems in getting aid to Puerto Ricans is that truck drivers and their machines are missing. Drivers are likely in areas that have been destroyed or they may have evacuated to the mainland before the storm. Their trucks could have taken serious damage during Hurricane Maria and there is little hope of finding an operating repair shop.
Democrats will do everything possible to paint this as “Trump’s Katrina” despite decades of liberal policies leading to infrastructure and building codes that made the disaster orders of magnitude worse than it otherwise might have been.
The honest truth is the Puerto Rico is going to take years to get back to normal. There is no government effort that will change that. But hey, the Jones Act has been waived so feel good about that.

",No Vacancies: Airbnb shutters Beijing rentals ahead of Party Congress,"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. short-term rental service Airbnb Inc has removed listings in Beijing as the capital prepares to host a five-yearly Party Congress later this month, the most important event on China’s political calendar during which security is at its highest.
A Reuters search on Wednesday of Airbnb listings in the city’s center yielded “zero” results for all of October. Listings were present as recently as Tuesday evening for periods including the congress dates of Oct. 18 to 31.
“Due to external circumstances, homes in certain areas in Beijing are unavailable through October 31,” Airbnb said in an email to hosts reviewed by Reuters.
The move, mirrored by local rental firms, comes a week before the congress where President Xi Jinping is widely expected to consolidate power in a leadership reshuffle.
Such high-profile events are often accompanied by increased surveillance and online censorship. During the last Congress, in 2012, access to Alphabet Inc’s Google search engine was cut off. Google services have since been blocked in China.
For this year’s event, authorities have stepped up ID checks at metro stations and elsewhere in an effort to detain unregistered workers and others illegally residing in Beijing.

“EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES”
Four Airbnb hosts in the capital told Reuters they had received notices from the U.S. firm late on Tuesday, which said properties in certain areas of the city would be removed from its website until the end of the month due to “external circumstances”.
“Similar to action taken by other hospitality companies, Airbnb listings in certain areas in Beijing will be temporarily unavailable throughout October,” the company said in a statement to Reuters.
Short-term rentals were also unavailable during the same period via local services Xiaozhu.com and Tujia.com. Neither firm responded to requests for comment.
Airbnb and other home-stay sites occupy a legal grey area in China, where tourists are required to register accommodation with local police using a passport or identification card. The requirement is harder to enforce with short-term rentals.
The Ministry of Public Security and Beijing’s city police did not respond to faxed requests for comment.
“(The congress blackout) is a pain, but it’s not for such a long time,” said a 28-year-old press relations worker surnamed Liu, who rents out two flats on both Xiaozhu and Airbnb. “As long as (bookings) open again eventually, I don’t mind.”",1

The latest additions include the soon-to-open Cardamom Tented Camp and Bill Bensley -designed Shinta Mani Wild, both in southwest Cambodia, and Rosewood Luang Prabang in the jungles of Laos.
Better yet, many of Asia's hottest spots provide glimpses of elephants, gibbons and leopards through safari-style excursions.
""It is different than an African safari,"" John Roberts, director of elephants at the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation, tells CNN Travel.
""The nature of the forests and wildlife allow you to be much more intimate. Even in deepest tiger, leopard, rhino, sloth and bear territory -- with a good guide, you can safely walk and spend time concentrating on birds, butterflies and plant life between encounters with large mammals.""
Looking for adventure that doesn't sacrifice comfort? Here are the top luxury tent experiences in the Asia region.

Cardamom Tented Camp
Wildlife is slowly returning to the national parks around the Cardamon Tented Camp.
A collaborative project from YAANA Ventures sustainable travel group, Cambodia's Wildlife Alliance conservation organization and Thailand-based Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation, the Cardamom Tented Camp sits on a protected stretch of land that was once a hotbed of logging and poaching.
Accessible only by boat, the camp's nine luxury tents overlook the Preak Tachan river and nearby grasslands in a stretch of land in southwest Cambodia , between Botum Sakor National Park and the Southern Cardamom National Park.
""The wildlife is slowly coming back after decades of unhindered poaching,"" says Roberts, who is the group director of sustainability and conservation at the camp, an initiative of Bangkok-headquartered Minor Group.
""We have Asiatic wild dogs, clouded leopards, mouse deer, sun bears, hog badgers, gibbons, macaques, elephants and more.""
The tented experience is complemented by a riverside restaurant, a floating pier and a slew of safari-style outings -- led by Wildlife Alliance rangers -- where travelers are bound to spot a mix of wildlife.
""It's important to pick camps and lodges that actively preserve the forest,"" says Roberts.
""They will tend to have the best guides who are often either local community ex-poachers or research scientists -- or a combination of both.""
The camp is due to open November 1.
Shinta Mani Wild -- The Bensley Collection
A new project from acclaimed resort designer Bill Bensley -- in partnership with Wildlife Alliance, Fauna & Flora International, The Royal University of Phnom Penh and the Cambodian government -- Shinta Mani Wild aims to be an unparalleled wildlife sanctuary.
Hugged by three national parks -- Kirirom, Bokor and Cardamom -- in southwest Cambodia, the 15 tents promise an immersive experience with nature.
A typical day could include multiple adventures, from river expeditions on what's said to be Southeast Asia's last wild estuarine system, to trekking through the forests where travelers can spot wild elephants, gibbons and bears.
To spot animal migrations, the best time to visit is the dry season -- from November to March.
Better yet, the beautifully designed tents incorporate elements of Cambodian architecture together with retro motifs that recall the days of colonial expeditions.
When open in mid-2018, the resort will feature a restaurant and bar perched next to a waterfall serving locally sourced food, a spa and also highlight conservation projects from The Shinta Mani Foundation.

Rosewood Luang Prabang
Also scheduled to open in early 2018, Rosewood Luang Prabang will sit about 10 minutes outside of Luang Prabang -- a UNESCO World Heritage Site -- in Laos
It's glamping 2.0 -- picture a dense jungle, waterfalls, open-air showers, private dining decks and a mix of 23 palatial villas and luxury tents nestled in an untouched natural environment
In addition to the stylish accommodation, Rosewood also has a Laotian bistro, bar and Rosewood Spa in the works.
Four Seasons Tented Camp Golden Triangle
CNN Travel's Elite Escapes visits the Four Season's luxury tent complex in Thailand's Chiang Rai province.
Claw-foot tubs, antique furniture, open-air showers, massive decks -- the all-inclusive Four Seasons Tented Camp Golden Triangle transports travelers to the early days of exploration thanks to the handiwork of resort designer Bill Bensley.
there are 15 tents scattered amidst the jungle, plus one massive Explorer's Lodge with two separate bedrooms and a private plunge pool.
The setting of the Golden Triangle -- where northern Thailand , Myanmar and Laos intersect -- combines dense jungles, grasslands, rivers and a camp for rescued elephants.
The elephants make appearances around the tented camp in the mornings for bathing times with mahouts (elephant trainers) and can be seen wandering around through the vast sanctuary.
Elsewhere on the grounds, travelers will find a bar with excellent sunset views, an open-air Thai restaurant, a wine cellar (where you can enjoy private tastings before dinner), cooking classes and a spa that seems to float in the middle of the jungle.

Amanwana
Not many wild camps have views like this.
Claiming its own private island and marine reserve in eastern Indonesia, Amanwana takes camping to the next level.
Located on Moyo Island, the property's 20 ""tented suites"" have been kitted out with high ceilings, air-conditioning, hardwood floors, king-sized beds and large windows.
The two types -- one surrounded by jungle, others beachfront -- are within easy walking distance of the coastline, where snorkeling and scuba diving will reward travelers with colorful reef life.
On the grounds, there's also an open-air restaurant and the Jungle Cove Spa -- a chance to unwind in the company of macaque monkeys and tamarind trees.
Those in search of more animal interactions will find loads of wildlife on jungle treks around the island.
That is, if it doesn't find you first: Many types of fauna, including deer, are said to make appearances around the tents in the early mornings.

Sandat Glamping Tents
Hidden away in the jungles and rice paddies surrounding Ubud, central Bali, Sandat Glamping Tents offers five luxury tents and three lumbung -- essentially thatched roof bungalows inspired by traditional Bali barns.
The whimsical accommodations marry elements of Balinese culture with romantic accents imported from Italy -- where the brand introduced its first glamping experience near Venice, in 2009.
While each room has its own unique characteristics, many feature billowing drapes, Venetian-style chandeliers, four-poster beds and private pools.
After a day of exploring the temples, biking through rice paddies or river rafting, there's a lounge and bar, a cathedral-like bamboo restaurant, or even a private dinner served under the stars.
And if you're here for a wellness retreat, good news: One of the prettiest parts of the property is the yoga pavilion -- a gorgeous bamboo structure encircled by rice paddies.
Elephant Hills
Thailand's Elephant Hills Rainforest Camp.
One of Thailand's first luxury tented camps, Elephant Hills brings the tropical jungle right to your doorstep.
The company has two distinct camps -- both inside Khao Sok National Park, in southern Thailand -- that offer differing experiences.
As the name suggests, The Elephant Camp promises interactions with these gentle giants, many of which have been retired from the logging industry.
Visitors can admire the elephants in their natural habitat, as well as bathe and feed them at select times during the day.
Meanwhile, the Rainforest Camp floats along Cheow Lan Lake, where canoes and trekking adventures are close at hand.
But the best part might be the tranquility. Travelers open their tent flaps and are just a few feet from the still lake -- a peaceful way to start the morning.
To visit both glamping spots, travelers can opt for a Jungle Lake Safari, which includes a night at the Elephant Camp and two nights on the lake.

Damodra Desert Camp
Offering a totally different type of safari, Damodra Desert Camp , in northern India, showcases the beauty of the desert.
Here, travelers can experience the vast, windswept dunes of the Thar Desert -- about 18 miles outside of Jaisalmer, in Rajasthan -- without sacrificing any creature comforts.
The Swiss cottage-inspired tents include air-conditioning, private patios, and colorful upholstery that pays tribute to the area.
During the day, visitors will most likely partake in a camel safari or enjoy a sandboarding session on the dunes.
Come nightfall, the camp comes alive with live music and Indian dinners -- all under the starlit desert sky.
Norden Travel
Each of Norden Travel's tents is slightly different.
Owned and operated by a local Tibetan couple, Norden Travel -- in China's central Gannan region -- the camp showcases the beautiful pastures and rich culture with eight pinewood cabins and four luxury yak-hair tents.
The rustic decor and hardwood floors feels at once sophisticated and cozy -- the kind of place you could hole up for a while and clear your mind.
Each tent and cabin is slightly different -- some nestled in the brush while others alongside the river -- but all have outdoor seating areas, stoves, and peaceful, pastoral views.
While it's not quite a safari, a trek around the surrounding mountains and hills will likely reward guests with sightings of gazelle and pheasants, yaks and of course sheep.
In addition, the camp also organizes horseback riding, village visits, guided hikes, yoga and private tours of Labrang Monastery, one of the six major Tibetan Buddhist monasteries.
SUJÁN JAWAI and Sher Bagh Relais & Chateaux
A rustic retreat in Rajasthan, SUJÁN JAWAI provides 10 white canvas tents and all the modern amenities you could hope for, including an on-site spa, restaurant, swimming pool, yoga and more.
Dotting the sandy Aravalli hills -- a three-hour drive from either Jodhpur or Udaipur in northern India -- the camp takes inspiration from its rugged surrounds, using leopard motifs, wildlife photography, and lots of bright red accents throughout.
With their luxury tent as a home base, travelers can be as lazy or as adventurous as they please.
The options include private bush picnics, sunset game drives, afternoon tea, evening cocktails and leisurely campfire dinners.
There's also a half-day excursion to the incredible carved Ranakpur Jain Temple and the 15th-century fort Kumbhalgarh -- a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Even just wandering around the property -- which is actively involved in big cat conservation -- there's no shortage of flora and fauna to admire.
Of course, the best experience will be with guides in town. On a Jeep-led safari, the camp's experts will lead travelers across grasslands, granite hills and lakes for the best views of leopards, antelopes, crocodiles, boars and flamingos.
SUJÁN JAWAI's sister property, Sher Bagh , transports travelers to 1920s-style safaris within India's Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve.
By day, enjoy safaris and excursions and British-Raj style lunches; by night, settle into a tiger-themed pad.
Tiger Tops
A twin-bed safari tent at Nepal's Tiger Tops site.
A pioneer of sustainable tourism in Nepal, Tiger Tops was one of the first companies to set up a tented camp in Chitwan National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site in south-central Nepal.
""Perhaps because I spent so much time there, some of my most memorable (safari) experiences were in Chitwan,"" recalls Roberts.
""From the breakfast golghar (a thatched, central building) at the old Tiger Tops Tented Camp, I watched rhinos mating, as well as a mother tiger and her four cubs.""
In 2012, government policies required all hotels and lodges to move outside of the national park.
Today, the company operates three locations across the country -- including recently opened Tiger Tops Elephant Camp, with comfortable tented accommodations.
The British-Nepali company provides elephants a chain-free refuge in their natural territory, where travelers can interact and observe the pachyderms' daily routine.",1

",DHS explores transforming immigration without Congress,"Washington (CNN) Even as the Trump administration is asking Congress to approve a tough overhaul of the nation's immigration laws, the Department of Homeland Security is also quietly exploring ways it could transform the US immigration system on its own.
The department has been examining a range of subtle modifications to immigration policies that could have major consequences, including limiting protections for unaccompanied minors who come to the US illegally, expanding the use of speedy deportation proceedings, and tightening visa programs in ways that could limit legal immigration to the US, according to multiple sources familiar with the plans.
None of the policies being explored are finalized, according to the sources, and are in various stages of development. Any of them could change or fall by the wayside. Some of them are also included at least in part in the wish list of immigration priorities that President Donald Trump sent to Congress this week, and it's unclear whether the administration will wait to see the results of negotiations over the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that President Donald Trump has chosen to end.
Still, the proposals under consideration illustrate the extent to which the administration could attempt to dramatically change immigration in the US through unilateral executive action.
""Do you think Obama did a lot? That's my answer,"" said one former DHS official when asked how transformative the change could be. ""They could do quite a bit.""
DACA itself was an example of how former President Barack Obama, frustrated with congressional inaction, sought to use executive authority to take action on immigration, putting in place the program to protect young undocumented immigrations brought to the US as children from deportation in 2012.
But the administration is now exploring rolling back more Obama-era policies, and changing even older systems.
DHS did not respond to a request for comment about the policies being explored or its process.
Targeting protections for unaccompanied minors
One effort underway is exploring what can be done about unaccompanied children (UACs), a category of undocumented immigrants who are caught illegally crossing the border into the US, are under age 18, and are not accompanied or met by a parent or guardian in the US. Those UACs, by law and legal settlement, are handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services for settling in the US, given protections from expedited removal proceedings and given special opportunities to pursue asylum cases in the US.
DHS and the Department of Justice have been exploring options to tighten the protections for UACs, including no longer considering them UACs if they're reunited with parents or guardians in the US by HHS or once they turn 18.
In a previously unreported memo , obtained by CNN, the general counsel of the Executive Office of Immigration Review, which manages the nation's immigration courts, wrote in a legal opinion that the administration would be able to decide a UAC was no longer eligible for protections -- a sea change in the way the 2008 law granting those protections has been interpreted.
The Trump administration has portrayed the UAC protections as a loophole in the law that can be exploited by gangs, though experts have testified before Congress that the minors under the program are more likely to be victimized by gangs in the US due to a lack of a support network than to be gang members. The administration also has sought to crack down on parents who pay smugglers to bring their children into the US illegally, even to escape dangerous situations in Central America.
The White House also asked Congress to amend the 2008 law to restrict UAC protections.
In previously unreported comments made last month at a security conference in Washington, acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Tom Homan said that ICE is actively looking at the adults HHS places UACs with, and if they are in the US illegally, they will be processed for deportation -- and if a smuggler was paid, they could be prosecuted for human trafficking.
""You cannot hide in the shadows, you can't be an illegal alien in the United States, have your undocumented child smuggled at the hands of a criminal organization, and stay in the shadows,"" Homan said. ""We're going to put the parents in proceedings, immigration proceedings, at a minimum. ... Is that cruel? I don't think so. Because if that child is really escaping fear and persecution, he's going to stand in front of an immigration judge to plead his case, his parents should be standing shoulder to shoulder with him. I call that parenting.""
DHS is also continuing to weigh its options to expand the use of expedited removal more generally -- a speedier process of deportation that bypasses a lengthy court process in particular cases -- as authorized by Trump's January executive order on immigration.
Legal immigration tightening
Other efforts in the works include ways to tighten legal avenues to come to the US.
Two policies being looked at are the subject of litigation in the DC Circuit court -- work authorizations for spouses of high-skilled visa holders and an expansion of a program that allows STEM students to stay in the US an extra two years for training.
Both policies were challenged in the courts, and now the administration is considering whether to roll them back.
On the spousal authorizations, DHS told the court as much in a filing last month, asking for extra time for the DHS review to finish.
That filing points to a DHS review of ""all"" of the agency's immigration policies, citing the President's Executive Order to ""buy American and hire American.""
""Executive Order 13,788 is an intervening event necessitating careful, considered review of all of DHS's immigration policies to ensure that the interests of US workers are being protected,"" the attorneys wrote, citing the order's instructions to create new rules, if necessary, ""to protect the interests of United States workers in the administration of our immigration system.""
DHS has also moved to tighten asylum claim credibility thresholds, and is exploring asking Congress for more authority to do so. Another target is reportedly cultural exchange visas, which according to The Wall Street Journal are also under scrutiny after the ""hire American"" order.
Further unilateral moves wouldn't even require policy changes, immigration attorneys fear. Attorneys who represent immigration clients fear that simply by slowing down the visa process, DHS could substantially decrease the number of immigrants admitted to the United States. US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced this summer it would begin requiring interviews for all green card applicants on employment and refugee grounds, and that it would roll out required interviews for other categories over time, adding a substantial and potentially lengthy hurdle to achieving legal permanent residency.
""If the wait time for naturalizations increases by three months, USCIS can naturalize 25% fewer people per year, which would mean millions of people over a four-year period,"" said Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney and former Obama administration DOJ official. ""Even without a policy change, the administration (can accomplish) dramatic reductions to legal immigration through increases in processing times and taking a hawkish approach to finding reasons for denials of immigration applications.""
DHS pointed CNN to statistics showing no increase in the rate of denials of immigration applications, though the backlog of pending applications has grown steadily over the past two years.
Internal jockeying
Sources familiar with the inner workings of DHS describe an environment where political appointees and policy staff with strongly held opinions circulate ideas that sometimes reach the press before front office and secretarial staff are even aware of the discussions.
While political appointees and career officials are not described as butting heads, some of policy ideas do end up moderated by career employees on practical grounds. One source also described some employees of USCIS, which administers DACA, as getting emotional when the plan was made to end the program.
""Once it gets to a senior level, there are pretty robust discussions,"" another source familiar said. ""And once it gets to that level there are folks with ideas, and then folks who have been around for a while who say, 'That won't work.'""
Those competing ideas are then ultimately decided on by the secretary and high-level decision makers, though sources say political appointees are sometimes in a position to have influence over what information flows to the front office and top officials.
""The secretary and the decision makers end up with that (dynamic),"" the source said.",1

Asthma is a chronic disease affecting more than 25 million people in the United States. Patients suffering from asthma feel shortness of breath, chest tightness and experience coughing and wheezing. Asthma symptoms are due to inflammation and spasms of the lungs’ airways and can be triggered by infections, exercise, allergens, strong smells, and cold air. There is no cure for asthma, but there are many effective treatments. For decades, asthma treatment has been focused on the complications of asthma, including inflammation, as well as relief of acute symptoms. Common medications include inhaled steroids, leukotriene antagonists and bronchodilators. However, despite wide use of these medications, many patients still experience continued symptoms and uncontrolled asthma. Fortunately, new therapies are now available which target specific root causes of asthma, not just the effects. These therapies are called biologics.

The Role of Biologics in Asthma Treatment
A biologic is a medication that is created from something living (such as microorganisms or cells). This is in comparison to the traditional synthetic or chemically based drugs with which we are most familiar, and commonly use.
Biologics are distinctive because they are able to recognize and bind to specific cells in the body associated with a specific disease. Thus biologics are very specialized and can customize disease treatment.
The biologic basis of asthma is complicated. There are numerous, multifaceted interactions between cells in the body and the chemicals these cells release. Biologics for asthma are revolutionary new injectable treatments that attack some of the specific players in the asthma game. Asthma biologics are antibodies, which work by blocking the cells and chemicals that cause inflammation and airway constriction before they can cause damage. Currently, asthma biologics have two distinct targets: IgE antibodies and eosinophils.
Biologics Targeting IgE
The first biologic approved to treat asthma was omalizumab (Xolair). It is an injectable medication indicated for allergic asthma; it targets IgE antibodies, which are involved in producing allergic reactions. Allergies and asthma go hand in hand and patients with allergic asthma tend to have elevated levels of IgE antibodies circulating in their bodies. IgE antibodies cause cells to release chemicals which lead to airway swelling and narrowing and thus asthma symptoms. Omalizumab itself is an antibody and works by grabbing IgE so it is no longer available to interact with allergic cells. As a result, omalizumab reduces asthma exacerbations, decreases asthma symptoms and decreases the use of traditional asthma medications including steroids. Targeting IgE antibodies has been an effective way to treat allergic asthma and use of omalizumab has been incorporated into the asthma management guidelines for severe asthmatics.
Biologics Targeting Eosinophils
Eosinophils are type of white blood cell. Normally, the role of these cells is to fight infections—specifically, parasitic infections. However, eosinophils are found in high numbers in the airways of asthmatic patients. Eosinophils play an active role in asthma by releasing chemicals that damage the airway lining and cause constriction of the airway. Reducing the number of eosinophils in the body reduces asthma symptoms, and a new treatment has been developed to do this for patients with severe asthma. This biologic treatment, mepolizumab (Nucala), is an injectable medication that works by lowering eosinophil levels. As a result, it can reduce rates of asthma exacerbations and allow patients to lower the doses of their daily inhaled steroid medications.
At this time, the use of biologics is recommended for patients with severe asthma. Patients whose asthma is not controlled on inhaled steroids or combination medications are likely to benefit from these treatments. Biologics can be considered a game changer for these patients, as conventional treatment options have not been effective for severe asthmatics. Many new biologic treatments are coming down the pipeline, including those that focus on even more targets in the asthma pathway. We can anticipate more and more of these progressive, specialized treatments in the next few years.

(Before It's News)
Until Antonio Brown lucked his way through Eric Weddle and over the goalline (thanks, Dean “Swiss” Pees, for letting Pittsburgh march down the field unimpeded, btw!), it looked like the Ravens were about to beat Pittsburgh for the FIFTH straight time. As it stands, the good guys have still won six of eight and nine of 13. Hopefully they can make it seven of nine on Sunday.
Let’s look at this week’s stats, quotes, and more, c/o Casa Mia’s White Marsh.
KNOW THY ENEMY
SERIES HISTORY
QUOTES OF THE WEEK
QB Joe Flacco on how the team approaches this upcoming game against Pittsburgh after a Week 3 defeat:
“You’ve got to keep guys’ heads up. So much of this game is confidence and going out there and getting it done. If you let one of these kinds of games creep into your mind and debilitate you, then you’ll be in trouble. So we’ve just got to make sure we keep our heads up and keep going.”
G Tony Bergstrom on John Harbaugh and the culture that’s been set in Baltimore:
“I can’t even describe what a great place it is. … The culture that coach Harbaugh has created here is unmatchable in the NFL.”
John Harbaugh on how to explain the Ravens’ rash of injuries and working with injured players:
“We don’t forget our [injured] guys. Tavon [Young] is in there every single day rehabbing and getting ready for next year, and I see him every day and talk to him. Those guys are still part of our team. The team is more than the original depth chart. The team is an evolving process. It is guys on the practice squad. It is young guys developing as players. It is guys you bring in when you have to – when you have some of the injuries we have at certain positions. There is no one single answer. I can’t answer it any better than you can, but I am not trying to. I don’t think you have to. You have to move on, and you make the best of it.”
The Baltimore Sun’s Childs Walker on the Ravens’ defensive rookies making a long-lasting impact:
“[Tyus] Bowser, meanwhile, has already become an important cog in the defense, lining up on the other side from [Terrell] Suggs and also dropping into coverage in a way [Tim] Williams cannot. He had both a sack and an interception against Cleveland [in Week 2], and something tells me that won’t be the only time in his career he pulls off that double. Between the two outside linebackers and first-round pick Marlon Humphrey, who continues to stand out with his aggressive play at cornerback, this could go down as a memorable defensive draft class.”
John Harbaugh on the depth and competition of the defensive line:
“The competition at D-line is heated. It is tremendous. Those guys want to play, and they are fighting like crazy in practice. It makes our practices better. We have young players that need to get better, and when they get their chance, they need to play well.”
GETTING TO KNOW YOU ~ Q&A with C.J. Mosley
What is the best thing a coach could say about you?
“I’m dedicated, I work hard, and I take my job seriously. You never want anybody to say that you are a lazy player or that you don’t have a good work ethic. As a man and as a football player, working hard and taking my job seriously are two things I pride myself in and that is what I want them to notice.”
After reaching the Pro Bowl in two out of your first three years, what drives you?
“I feel like I’m not one of the top linebackers in the league, at least recognition-wise. I always want to be the best, but I feel like right now, I’m regarded as ‘another good linebacker.’ I want to strive to be one of the best, if not the best, linebackers in the league. Team-wise, I want to lead this defense to be the best defense the NFL has ever seen, and I want to win a Super Bowl.”
What was your advice to your brother, Jamey, who plays at Alabama?
“He took a different route than me. He didn’t get a scholarship like I did; he had to earn his scholarship. He just had his second start this year, so his journey started way different. It has been a tough road for him, but he has kept his head up and has started to earn some playing time. I have definitely talked to him a few times, because there were times where he felt like he put all of the work in during practice and still wasn’t playing. Even though he has my last name, he is definitely making his own way.”
What has been your favorite win so far while in Baltimore?
“I guess it is always good to beat the Steelers. But, I honestly don’t think we have had that big, key win since I have been here. We are hoping that comes this year.”
What about your hardest loss?
“The hardest loss is definitely last year against the Steelers [in Game 15]. Losing on the last play in such a big game made that really tough. When you lose a game like that, it’s going to stick with you and serve as motivation.”
What makes John Harbaugh who he is?
“His drive for perfection. As a man, as a coach himself and what he demands from other coaches and this team. He always looks for ways to find an advantage and preaches practicing the little things, so when a situation comes in a game, we are almost always prepared for it.”
Who was your favorite NFL team and player growing up?
“It’s funny, because my favorite teams were because of my favorite players. It was the Ravens and the Bears – because of Ray Lewis and Brian Urlacher.”
HEY, YOU LOOK FAMILIAR! ~ Key Connections
Ravens WR Mike Wallace (left) was selected by the Steelers in the third round of the 2009 draft and spent four seasons in Pittsburgh. … CB Brandon Boykin (Injured Reserve) also spent the 2015 season with the Steelers.
Steelers practice squad RB Fitzgerald Toussaint started his career as a Raven as a rookie free agent. … Steelers LB James Harrison was signed to the Ravens’ offseason roster in 2004.
Steelers inside linebackers coach Jerry Olsavsky (1998) and defensive backs coach Carnell Lake (2001) played the final seasons of their NFL careers with the Ravens.
Steelers WRs coach Richard Mann served in the same capacity for the Baltimore Colts (1982-84) and Baltimore Ravens (1997-98). In 1985, Mann was hired as the wide receivers/tight ends coach for the Browns, where he coached Ravens GM/executive vice president and Hall of Fame TE Ozzie Newsome (1978-90).
Steelers S Sean Davis (2011-15) and WR Darrius Heyward-Bey(2005-08) played at Maryland.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/04/health/mental-illness-zack-mcdermott/index.html,How a 'madman' hopes to spark conversations about mental illness,"(CNN) The signs that he was spiraling downward were everywhere. They appeared in his scribbles in red marker all over his apartment walls. They materialized when he stripped down to his skivvies at a happy hour, after winning a court case while sporting a new mohawk.
And they screamed out as he raced around New York City for 12 hours, darting through traffic, bounding through a dog park on all fours, assuming strangers were actors in his very own reality TV show.
By the time police handcuffed Zack McDermott -- then crying, shoeless and shirtless on a subway platform -- it was clear he'd had a psychotic break.
The 26-year-old Brooklyn public defender was in the midst of a severe manic episode. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he spent 10 days in the psychiatric ward. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder , a manic-depressive illness that afflicts more than 6 million American adults, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness . Like most mental illnesses, it is often misunderstood, stigmatized and spoken about in whispers, if it's spoken about at all.
McDermott, now 34, who traded in the practice of law for full-time writing in 2015, is on a mission to change that.
Zack McDermott gave up the practice of law in 2015 to focus on writing.
McDermott has offered glimpses of his story in various publications, introducing audiences to the tale of him and his mother, the constant supporter whom he calls ""the Bird.""
""The 'madman' had raided my checking account, and there was no overdraft protection for 'Sorry, I had a manic episode and rang up $800 worth of novelty T-shirts at Urban Outfitters,' "" he wrote recently in the New York Times . ""I'd taken to calling the Bird in the middle of the night, every night, to hear her voice. ... She couldn't tell me that everything was going to be O.K. because the truth was, she wasn't sure. All she could do was make sure she kept answering the phone.""
He's put himself out there for others struggling with mental illnesses, including the countless clients public defenders stand up for in courts, men and women who don't have the support networks and privileges -- including easy access to health care -- that he's had. Already, he's seeing a payoff in opened conversations.
""It's no longer surprising to me how many people have stories of their own or a loved one's struggle with mental health that they are dying to share but embarrassed to talk about,"" said McDermott, who says he's been flooded with responses. ""I hope we can give folks a little permission to talk about these things, because it's important, and it's everywhere.""
One among millions
And adults in homeless shelters and prisons or jail are more likely to have a mental illness than those in the general population. More than 26% of adults in American homeless shelters have a serious mental illness, according to a 2010 report by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, and a US Department of Justice special report released in June shows 14% of state and federal prisoners and 26% of jail inmates have ""reported experiences that met the threshold for serious psychological distress."" Even more inmates, 37% of those in prison and 44% of those in jail,"" had been told in the past by a mental health professional that they had a mental disorder.""
Too many adults with mental illness go untreated. Nearly 60% went without mental health services in 2014, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and odds of getting treatment often fall along racial lines . For example, African-Americans and Hispanic Americans accessed mental health services at half the rate of whites, the administration found in 2015.
In a number of ways, one might say, McDermott was lucky -- not least of all because of the mother who raised him.
'Russian roulette'
Hours before McDermott was born, his Uncle Eddie -- diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia -- was taken away by ambulance and institutionalized.
The reality that mental illness ran in the family shaped how Cindy Cisneros-McGilvrey, the Bird, watched her son. She tried to stay positive and not worry, but there was no denying that Zack, her middle child, concerned her, McGilvrey says. Early on, he was difficult, volatile, prone to pounding his fists and holding his breath till he turned blue. He trusted few, and McGilvrey says she lost babysitters because of him.
The first Thanksgiving after their parents divorced in 1988, Zack McDermott (far right) is pictured with his siblings, Alexa and Adam.
By the time he went off to elementary school, though, he'd adjusted socially. Her son was highly intelligent and funny, but he was also a smartass who ""suffered no fools,"" she said. Boredom drove him to torment others, and he liked to make people uncomfortable. He'd do striptease acts, which was ironic given what transpired as he unraveled in New York years later.
When he was in law school at the University of Virginia, McGilvrey worried about his excessive partying. Given her brother Eddie's history, which included abuse of drugs, her own struggles with depression and her father's alcoholism, she says she issued warnings.
""Zack, you know the odds aren't in your favor,"" she remembered saying to him. ""Let's not play Russian roulette with the gene pool.""
McGilvrey, an educator in Wichita, Kansas, who helps adults of all ages earn high school diplomas, was vigilant. She read up on mental illnesses. She attended counseling with her children after her divorces, first from McDermott's biological father and then from his stepfather. The Bird watched out for her boy like a hawk.
McDermott doesn't dispute that he was a handful.
""I was an awful kid,"" he said, ticking off his offenses. ""I'd been arrested five or six times, got into a lot of fights, totaled a couple cars and partied way too much from 14 on.""
There were some bouts of clinical depression in high school, college and law school, he says, but that didn't faze him.
""I felt a little crazy,"" he said, ""but good old-fashioned crazy.""
The Bird swoops in
The night he was hauled off to Bellevue by police, McDermott's roommates called his mother to tell her what had happened. She'd never been to the East Coast, let alone the Big City. But by the next morning, the Bird took flight to be with him.
She'd didn't know how to hail a cab and arrived with five $100 bills, she said: ""one in my bra, one in each shoe and one in each back pocket.""
At the hospital, McGilvrey stood on her tiptoes to peer through a window and see her son. The mohawk and ""Fu Manchu mustache"" threw her, she said, as did the 35 pounds he'd lost.
""I knew it was Zack, but he didn't look like Zack,"" she said. ""He didn't talk like Zack. Even his gait was different. He was not aware of his surroundings or what was going on.""
Zack McDermott's mother, Cindy Cisneros-McGilvrey, or the Bird, remains a source of constant support.
She entered the room and stood behind the yellow line she wasn't allowed to cross. When she announced who she was, he didn't believe her. Then he leaned into her, allowed her to hug him, and she called him ""Gorilla,"" the nickname she uses for her dark-haired, barrel-chested boy. That's when he knew it was her.
During his 90-day leave of absence from work, she would take him home first to Wichita, where he remained for more than a month. But for the 10 days he was institutionalized, her days revolved around her visits to him, during which she stayed strong.
""I did not cry in front of him,"" she said. ""I cried all the time when I wasn't with him. ... I could not shake the image of my brother,"" who died at 42 after 15 years of being institutionalized.
Every second of every visiting hour, she was at McDermott's side. She hated to leave. Even in his compromised state, he remained his funny and thoughtful self.
""Bird, you better leave, because they're going to lock you up too, and then what are we going to do?"" she remembers him saying to her, allowing them both to laugh.
Fulfilling a purpose
The average onset age for bipolar disorder is 25, and McDermott presented as a textbook Bipolar I Disorder case, his longtime psychiatrist said. Bipolar I is assigned to those who have severe episodes of mania and, usually, depression.
Dr. Prameet Singh, the New York City psychiatrist who's treated McDermott since 2010, says the diagnosis is sometimes tossed around too easily when people are really moody. The crippling protracted effect of Bipolar I, when not treated, far exceeds any kind of mood swing, he says.
It's hard to say what set off McDermott, but Singh says his alcohol and drug use -- he smoked a lot of marijuana -- didn't help. Nor did his high-stress job and lack of sleep.
In the years since that first episode, there have been a few others.
McDermott, though, has been ""inordinately lucky,"" Singh said, because the psychiatric medication that works for him was identified quickly and results in no side effects. He takes his meds like clockwork, stopped smoking marijuana, cut back on his alcohol intake and has ""a really good internal barometer,"" a level of self-awareness that allows him to recognize when an episode is coming on, which helps him ward it off.
""I believe that my son is fulfilling his purpose,"" McDermott's mom says. ""He took something that was horrible and devastating and turned it into this book. Not only has it received critical acclaim already, I think it's going to give people permission to talk more openly about mental illness.""

Her son is reminded that he is not alone by the stories that have poured in since he published his own.
A mother wrote to tell him of her son's suicide. A guy wrote to say how he'd been arrested four times in a year, coinciding with four manic episodes. A man in his late 60s said he, too, was in his 20s when he had his psychotic break -- but pharmacology then wasn't where it is now.
""It's cool, because no one will usually cough this stuff up, but when you do, they want to share,"" McDermott said.
And even for those who are lucky enough to not be touched personally by mental illness, Gorilla and the Bird hope their experiences increase empathy and force much-needed conversations.
""Everyone is hurt, and everyone is wounded,"" McGilvrey says. ""It's not always obvious.""",1
http://dailybuzzlive.com/mother-accused-of-killing-newborn-and-living-with-the-dead-babys-body-for-3-months/,Mother Accused Of Killing Newborn And Living With The Dead Baby’s Body For 3 Months,"A New York woman is facing serious charges for not only reportedly killing her newborn infant, but for keeping the child’s body in her home with her and her two other kids for several months.
 
Police have charge Christina Colantonio of Batavia, New York with second-degree murder for allegedly killing her infant daughter and living with the body for approximately 3 months, according to Genesee County Dist. Atty. Lawrence Friedman.
 
Though prosecutors would not disclose the cause of death, authorities have told the NY Daily News that they “have enough evidence to come to a conclusion it was intentionally caused.”
 
Accused of killing the baby “shortly after birth,” WCVB reports an acquaintance who visited the 28-year-old’s home saw the body and contacted police. At a news conference, police Sgt. Todd Crossett claimed responding officers who found the baby girls remains were offered counseling.
 
 “It’s not something you see on a regular basis,” Crossett said. “They are the most vulnerable part of the population.”
 
Though Colantonio Has been arrested, a medical examiner will determine an official cause of death. Genesee County Dist. Atty. Lawrence Friedman disclosed that the investigation is still ongoing.

FINAL CONCLUSION ON VEGAS: The shooting probably happened, but not as stated and emergency responders were not allowed in to get the death toll as high as possible. This is the type of thing that happens in communist countries.
 
I gotta say it, I came across a SUPREMELY WEIRD PHOTO that irreparably destroys the official story (scroll down a little, it moved down the page)
 
I found a “supremely weird photo,” in beyond full HD. It shows the hotel clearly after the shooting, and no windows are missing. Seriously folks, this photo needs some explaining! If there was a shooting, it happened on the ground and this photo shows so much it also proves all they did afterward was let people die.
 
Update to this photo (below, now down the page a ways)
 
If there were 500 injured, where was the ambulance response? Were they told to stand down? And were the victims allowed to bleed out overnight to maximize the death count? Why no late night investigation or ongoing emergency response?
 
The photo below is being marketed as “Police secure area after Mandalay Bay shooting”. It appears legit. If so, there is no official story, it is DOA. Ok, to get things started. First of all, this photo is huge, and clear. save it (with a double click, not a right click) to desktop and then view it as large as needed to confirm the following:
 
 
 
1. The windows that should be broken by this time on Mandalay Bay are not broken. They must have been kicked out later in the night.
 
2. There is no ongoing medical cleanup, and the stage is turned off. You can’t see the ground, but it is obviously a no action moment. Additionally, there is no investigation happening at Mandalay Bay in the appropriate room because the lights are off. The appropriate room is 9 floors down from the top of where the vertical lights start, or 6 floors down from where the exterior (wider) concrete starts.
 
3. This photo is obviously staged, and was taken on Giles street. It is obvious the street is shut down at the time of this photo, thus confirming the time frame it was purportedly from. Traffic in Vegas never stops, you can’t have this type of photo going on at any time unless the street is shut down. Also, the street is covered in litter, which Vegas does not tolerate. This would strongly indicate that it was indeed taken after a horde of concert goers split.
 
WHAT IF the sound of gunfire was piped through the speakers, and it never happened at all? The speakers would surely be good enough to fake it. I am not going to expound on this, but I gotta say, this never made one second of news in Mexico which is very odd. Was this purely an American psy op? It is still clearly night time in this photo (below), why are there no police or ambulance lights present if there is a huge recovery operation underway? Why are the lights out in the room this happened in? Why are the windows still there? THINGS THAT MAKE YOU GO HMMMMMM . . . . .
 
 
 
DOUBLE CLICK the image, a right click will only save a low res 880 pixel version. This image is super clear at 3000 pixels width
 
Your browser will probably not open this image large enough to make what it is showing perfectly obvious. Use a real picture viewer (the normal windows one should work) and view it big.
 
 
 
 
Important to note: The left window that is later broken (after this photo) has a reflective or interior lit portion on it in this photo. It is not a drape sticking out, because it is only showing on the bottom portion of the window, and other similar anomalies show up on many windows in this photo. Please reference the other (daytime) photos that clearly show it is completely broken out later, which you can clearly see is not the case in this photo.
 
 
 
 
THINGS THAT MAKE YOU GO HMMMMMM . . . . .
 
 
 
MATT SUMMED IT UP PERFECT
 
 
 
(thanks, because I am fatigued and can’t do it that well right now)
 
I am getting ready to call this a HUGE HOAX. At a minimum, certain aspects of this are now a proven total HOAX. Matt said it right, and the really weird crap shown in the photos above basically proves Matt is right:
 
“I’m a huge fan of your site and have been following it daily since your work on MH370. I don’t think anyone except the patsy was shot in Vegas, and I think we have to look at the evidence that should exist but is entirely missing. We’re supposed to think 500 were injured but none of them posted a video of themselves with non-life-threatening injuries to show friends and family that they were alive? There also should have been a huge triage area active for hours and ambulances a quarter mile both up and down the street in perfect view of Mandalay and Luxor but not one of the hotel guests posts this either? I could go on.”
 
My response: YEP. After finding that high def photo, I don’t believe anything happened at all. If that is so, the only injuries were from crowd panic, and whoever set up GoFundMe reaped millions. I think they used the concert speakers to hoax it now. There’s just no getting over what that high def photo shows.

THIS VIDEO IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE IT PROVES THE STAGE CREW COOPERATED WITH THE SHOOTING
 
This video has been served by this web site more than 30,000 times. I still have plenty of bandwidth. GET THIS OUT THERE. HERE IS THE KEY VIDEO THAT DESTROYS THE LIE AND PROVES THE STAGE CREW COOPERATED BY LIGHTING THE CROWD UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE SO SHOOTERS COULD GET A LARGE NUMBER OF HEAD SHOTS. This is the same video that is posted below, with an explanation for how the audio in the video proves the shooters were right there, at the concert. if you already have it, you don’t need to click it again.
 
People are suspecting the snipers were on the Sphinx across the street. That would work. I still say they were probably above the stage, right where the huge bright lights come on. I don’t think any of the musicians were in on the plot. Stage crews would be easy to infiltrate. One thing is certain, they absolutely were not shooting from the 32nd floor.
 
IMPORTANT: I just noticed another detail – in the video above, which was taken from the back of the crowd, the gunfire sounds close, but not immediately close. In other videos, where the people were right at the front of the crowd, the gunfire sounds like it is RIGHT THERE. If the shots originated at Mandalay, there would not be that difference.
 
Here’s the Vegas conspiracy, as the “official” alt media consensus is putting it together.
 
Paddock was undercover FBI supplying arms to ISIS in America, Hillary fast and furious style. That fits, because he was a liberal. He did manage to get a bunch of guns up into the room for a gun deal.
 
Six FBI agents entered the room with a smart card key (all the hotel rooms in Vegas have had those for a while.) They have the security film footage of the perps dressed in normal civilian clothing but what looks like disguises including low drawn baseball caps and loose clothing. They entered the hotel room with a smart card. One used to open any room at the hotel but somehow they got one for this room. Apparently the hotel security saw this happen but thought nothing of it, and was told to go home after the events unfolded. Despite the fact that Paddock is FBI, the FBI decided to dispose of him for a psy op. They entered the room as gun buyers, killed Paddock and kicked out the windows as the operation unfolded. They created enough of a ruckus to convince people in surrounding rooms. Then they waited in the room while the FBI locked the area down.
 
After everything was locked down, the second wave of FBI agents kicked their way into the room to make it sound good for any witnesses hiding in neighboring rooms and the perpetrators for this part of the psy op walked out the front door, wearing FBI jackets. There is an airport nearby that they used to bug out. Most people suspect it was Israeli FBI agents that are now on a Mediterranean vacation.
 
QUESTION: Do I agree with this theory? Well, it sounds about right, provided it leaves room for the bulk of the shooting happening elsewhere. No muzzle flashes showing up from the 32nd floor at any point makes that part of the story a requirement.
 
If the security guard testimony of seeing six people enter the room with a smart card is accurate, and it probably is, SIX is a sacred Jewish number they attach to almost everything and the patsy had to die somehow. This would be precisely how a Jewish newspaper in Tel Aviv published the now official story LONG LONG LONG before the police could ever investigate adequately for anything of the sort to be published. It would take nothing for one of the six people who entered the room to phone home to Israel with a success story. This theory is probably bang on. You’ll probably see this theory take off.
 
 
 
THIS IS WHAT AN AK-47 LOOKS LIKE AT NIGHT
 
This video is also cached on this web site and can be saved with a right click. Muzzle flash video
 
 
 
 
My comment on this video: This plainly proves no one was shooting from the hotel, it is SO FREAKING BRIGHT no one in a million years could possibly have missed it, no video camera would either, it probably would have put flashes across the entire face of the hotel. This is also far brighter than what the people claiming the shooting happened on lower floors are showing as examples. No missing windows there plus not bright enough equals squad car strobe relections.
 
This stands as evidence the shooting happened from behind the stage lights, as I said, because only the stage lights could have possibly concealed the flashes. There is all kinds of video of this shooting and no flashes like this to be seen in any of them. The only light source bright enough to hide that much of a flash at night was the stage lights. The stage lights are clearly shown in the video I posted below, And have also also re-linked here. This is a crucial video I am serving from this site, because it contains the key info that destroys the official lie. For the accompanying report, scroll down to the headline “Shooter could not have been at Mandalay Bay”.

Myanmar's de facto leader was bestowed with the honorary title in 1997 in recognition of her long struggle for democracy and her ties to Oxford where she studied.
City councilors considered a cross-party motion to withdraw the honor on Monday night and concluded that that it was ""no longer appropriate"" for her to hold it.
The council said that it had written to Suu Kyi and asked her to ""do whatever she can to stop the ethnic cleansing in her country"" but had not received a response.
Over the years, Suu Kyi has often spoken of the warmth and kindness she received during her time in Britain.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/04/politics/mark-warner-richard-burr-russia-investigation/index.html,Hill Russia investigators: Panel still searching for 'any hint of collusion',"(CNN) Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said Wednesday that the panel ""has more work to do"" to determine whether there was collusion between Russian officials and Donald Trump's team during last year's presidential election.
""The committee continues to look into all evidence to see if there was any hint of collusion,"" Burr said at a Capitol Hill news conference, standing alongside the committee's top Democrat, Mark Warner of Virginia.
Burr said the committee continues to look for ""any hint of collusion"" but has not come to any initial conclusions on that question, as it is still conducting interviews and reviewing documents, including 25 additional interviews this month.
The news conference Burr and Warner held to provide a progress report on their monthslong probe underscored their investigation is growing in scope and is not shying away from the question of collusion — which Trump has repeatedly dismissed as a ""hoax.""
Burr and Warner said they have largely confirmed the conclusions the intelligence community reached under the Obama administration that the Russian government meddled in the 2016 US election.
While Burr sidestepped questions about whether the Russians were trying to help Trump, one of the conclusions the intelligence community found, he warned that the efforts to interfere are still ongoing and must be addressed ahead of the next round of US elections later this year and in 2018.
""We have not come to any determination on collusion or Russia's preferences,"" the North Carolina Republican said. ""It seems that the overall theme of the Russian involvement in the US elections was to create chaos at every level. And I would tell you the fact that we're sitting here nine months later investigating it, they have been pretty darn successful.""
Burr said he did not have a timeline on when the investigation will conclude, though he said somewhat wistfully that his ""aspirational goal"" was still to end by the end of year.
Burr ticked off the areas of possible collusion the committee had already probed, and also issued a blanket threat to future witnesses that they should testify voluntarily or face a subpoena.
""Future witnesses that we might ask to come in the future, I strongly suggest you come in and speak with us,"" Burr said. ""If we believe that you have something valuable to bring to the committee, if you don't voluntarily do it, I will assure you today you will be compelled to do it.""
He noted the committee had ""hit a wall"" in its effort to interview Christopher Steele , the author of a controversial dossier containing explosive allegations about Trump and top members of his campaign, and he called on Steele to meet with the panel.
Burr said that both he and Warner made personal efforts to reach Steele, but he had not accepted their invitations. Burr said the committee ""cannot decide the credibility"" of the dossier without understanding who paid for it and its sources.
CNN reported in early January t hat Trump was briefed on the dossier, which includes allegations about Trump's associates, finances and personal life, and Trump has gone on to dismiss its contents entirely as ""phony.""
Burr also said the panel had interviewed seven attendees of an April 2016 event at the Mayflower Hotel -- where then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak spoke briefly with Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- and their testimony was consistent. The panel also talked to everyone involved with the changing of the Republican platform on Ukraine, and Burr said the staff believed in what they were implementing.
Burr said the committee's examination of the memos of former FBI Director James Comey ""has reached a logical end as it relates to the Russia investigation,"" indicating the committee didn't plan to delve further into the question of obstruction of justice, something Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating.
Burr and Warner brought a chart to the news conference that detailed the amount of work the committee has done so far, including more than 100 interviews at over 250 hours, more than 4,000 transcript pages and 100,000 pages of documents reviewed.
Burr said the committee has interviewed every intelligence community official involved in drafting the report on Russian election meddling, as well as Obama administration officials involved.
The committee has spoken behind closed doors to members of the intelligence community as well as Trump's inner circle, including former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Kushner.
There are several public hearings on the horizon. The first is for Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, who had been scheduled for a private staff interview last month, but the committee postponed the appearance and invited him to a public session instead after Cohen provided a statement to the media denying any collusion with Russian officials.
The Senate intelligence panel has also invited Facebook, Twitter and Google to testify at a public hearing next month on Russia's use of social media in elections, which has become a major focus of the panel's probe in recent weeks.
Facebook on Monday provided Congress with copies of the 3,000 Russian-linked election ads it identified, as well as data including where the ads were targeted. CNN reported Tuesday that the ads targeted crucial swing states Wisconsin and Michigan
The Senate intelligence committee is one of three congressional panels that are investigating Russian election meddling and possible collusion, in addition to Mueller's investigation.

http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/defense-challenges-doctors-finding-kim-killing-case-50276833,Defense challenges doctor's finding in Kim killing case,"On the third day of the trial of two women accused of killing the estranged half brother of North Korea's leader, defense lawyers sought to discredit the prosecution's case, but it was the presentation of physical evidence that caused a stir.
Siti Aisyah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam have pleaded not guilty in the Feb. 13 murder of Kim Jong Nam using banned VX nerve agent at a crowded airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur.
The women have said they thought they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden-camera TV show and had been hoodwinked by men suspected of being North Korean agents. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is believed to have considered his older sibling a potential rival for power.
A judge and court officials wore face masks and surgical gloves in Malaysia's High Court as samples were admitted as evidence of where VX was found on Kim Jong Nam's body and clothing.
Prosecutors and defense lawyers then took a 20-minute break to examine the samples, which were sealed in transparent plastic bags. Most wore gloves and masks as a safety precaution after prosecutors warned the VX-tainted items may still be dangerous.
DR. MOHAMAD SHAH MAHMOOD, head of the Forensic Unit at Kuala Lumpur Hospital
Mohamad Shah, who testified Tuesday that he believed Kim's death was caused solely by ""acute VX poisoning,"" defended his finding, saying an expert chemist's report had clearly shown the presence of VX, and that was supported by his autopsy.
Defense lawyers have contended that the conclusion Kim was killed by VX was biased and prejudicial to the accused, saying the autopsy findings and clinical symptoms merely showed chemical poisoning.
Mohamad Shah said toxicology tests found six types of drugs in Kim's blood that are used to treat diabetes, hypertension and gout, but those drugs and the state of Kim's health would not have caused his swift death.
Under cross-examination by defense lawyers, he admitted he had limited knowledge of VX and nerve agents in general. He said he didn't know the amount of the poison that was used.
The defense lawyers also sought to cast doubt that VX was applied on Kim by the two women. They have said the defendants could not have carried out an attack with VX without being affected themselves.
Mohamad Shah agreed with a defense assertion that it would be tough to detect needle puncture marks on Kim's body because he was heavily tattooed, but said there was only a ""slim chance"" of needle poisoning. He acknowledged he would not know if VX had been given to Kim through food and drinks before he arrived at the airport.
Mohamad Shah agreed that VX in its liquid form is tasteless, odorless and sticky, syrupy or oily, making it difficult to clean off so a person can be decontaminated.
DR. RANJINI SIVAGANABALAN, government doctor specializing in clinical toxicology
Ranjini said VX can cause excessive salivation, sweating, vomiting, seizure, pinpoint-size eye pupils and diarrhea.
She said decontamination usually involves washing with soap and water, but agreed with the defense's assertion that this may not fully remove the poison, depending on the quantity applied.
The onset of VX poisoning is ""very rapid,"" with symptoms seen ""usually within seconds or minutes,"" Ranjini said. But if the dose is very low — and depending on temperature — it could take longer, she said, adding that VX may not be fatal at a very low dosage.
Ranjini disagreed with the defense's assertion that as little as 10 milligrams of VX, just a tiny drop, would be lethal to humans, saying there has been no experimentation on humans anywhere.",1

Walmart Puts Its Eggs in a Time-Saving Basket: Grocery Pickup Seeking an edge against Amazon, the retail giant is pushing a service that delivers your order to your car. Customers never have to step inside the store.

A personal shopper is something you might expect at Bergdorf Goodman or a boutique on Madison Avenue.
Not at the Walmart on Route 42 in Turnersville, N.J.
But that’s where you will find Joann Joseph and a team of Walmart workers each day, filling up shopping carts with boxes of Honeycomb cereal, Cheez-Its and salted peanuts.
The customers select their groceries online, and then the shoppers pick the items off the store shelves and deliver them to people when they arrive in the parking lot. Customers never have to step inside the store.
“It’s about saving people time,” Ms. Joseph said as she helped load groceries into the back of a minivan one morning.
Walmart, which is one of the largest food retailers in the United States, sees grocery pickup as a way to marry its e-commerce business with its gigantic network of stores — a goal that has eluded many other retailers. The company started ramping up the service two years ago, and it is now available in about 1,000 of Walmart’s 4,699 stores across the country.
The initiative is the latest salvo in Walmart’s retail battle with Amazon, and the centerpiece of its strategy to gain the upper hand in the pursuit of consumers looking to streamline their food shopping.

Many retailers are focused on new ways to deliver groceries to people’s homes — particularly in big cities. Walmart is betting big on the millions of Americans in suburban and rural areas who drive everywhere. The company is trying to make ordering groceries online and then picking them up in your car as seamless as a fast-food drive-through.
Groceries have become one of the most fiercely contested areas of retail. Amazon upped the ante in June with its $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods, giving it a major foothold in the industry. Lidl, the German supermarket chain, is also making a big push to open stores in the United States.
Grocery delivery companies like Fresh Direct have spawned a contest among traditional grocers and start-ups to offer faster home delivery.
Amid this heated competition, Walmart has been experimenting with different ways to get an edge. In a few cities, it works with Uber to deliver groceries to homes.
And last month, Walmart said it would begin testing a home-delivery service in which a worker loads the food into the refrigerator , even when no one is home. The customer can watch the process remotely from a home security camera and track when the delivery worker enters and leaves the house.
While these initiatives are limited to only a few states, the company’s grocery pickup is widespread. Walmart is betting that a big part of the country (“from Scranton to Sacramento,” one Walmart executive said) is more of a drive-through than delivery culture.
There is a risk that Walmart’s new grocery strategy could undercut its sales of other products. Selling groceries has lower profits, but it brings customers into the store regularly, allowing Walmart to push bigger-ticket items.
“That is the philosophy of the Supercenter: You put all these other categories under one roof,” said Gene German, a professor emeritus of food marketing at Cornell University. “So if the customers don’t go into the stores, that could be a negative.”
But Walmart believes that the “high touch” approach of online grocery ordering is improving people’s opinion of the shopping experience at its stores, making them more likely to purchase general merchandise in addition to food.
“We get feedback and how much they appreciate the time that we take” in fulfilling a grocery order, said Mike Turner, a vice president of Walmart’s e-commerce operations, said in an interview.
Walmart does not disclose its online grocery sales. But when the company reported its second-quarter results in August, it said online sales, including grocery, had increased 60 percent from a year earlier.
The company also indicated that overall food sales growth had been the best in five years.

For decades, Walmart was seen as the world’s foremost innovator in retail. But even as the company has become the world’s largest retailer, it has been overshadowed in many ways by Amazon’s rapid growth and many advancements.
Amazon’s long-term strategy for Whole Foods, however, is not clear. Amazon must figure out how to sync its core online business and warehouse network with more than 460 Whole Foods stores, many of which are in high-priced urban areas and can be costly to operate.
Walmart faces a different set of challenges and opportunities with its online grocery pickup — which were on display at the Supercenter in Turnersville, outside Philadelphia.
The strategy’s promise is that Walmart can uses its thousands of stores as mini-fulfillment centers, while also avoiding the costs of home delivery. But the store does not always function like a warehouse.
One morning, Ms. Joseph walked through the aisles, pushing a cart and scrolling through a hand-held device that listed the order a customer had placed online.
Like GPS services for cars, her device mapped out the most efficient route: She grabbed a box of Honeycomb in one aisle then a box of Lipton Berry Tea in another.
But when Ms. Joseph reached the peanut aisle, she hit a snag. The customer had ordered a five-pack of individual-size servings of salted peanuts.
There were no more individual-size packs. She checked the candy and snack displays at the cash registers, but there were none there, either.
So Ms. Joseph improvised. Borrowing a colleague’s iPhone, she calculated the amount of peanuts in the pack of individual servings, and then she selected a jug of peanuts with comparable volume.
“Your instinct needs to kick in,” Ms Joseph said. “And you go with it.”
Each substitution is supposed to be clearly marked with a sticker so the customer is not surprised.
Customers order their groceries online and then can pick them up at the store, a few hours later during a certain time window.

Walmart is also showering grocery pickup customers with perks — Easter eggs hidden in grocery bags, a “beauty box” for moms at Mother’s Day, dog biscuits and discounts for recruiting new customers.
It’s unclear how the company will be able maintain this kind of dedicated service if a store is inundated with pickup orders, which in many stores are free of charge and require an order of $30 or more.
Walmart said it had hired thousands of workers to staff the new service across its many stores.
“This is something Walmart could get into easily and quickly,” Mr. German said. “And it would send a message to shareholders: We are not going to be passive. We are going to be proactive.”
Customers who order online choose a one-hour window in which they can pick up their groceries. When they arrive at the Walmart parking lot, they pull into designated grocery pickup spots, which at some stores resemble a gas station with a canopy overhead. Minutes later, a personal shopper emerges from the store with bags of groceries.
When Laura Rothwein of Clayton, N.J., pulled up in her minivan to the side of the Turnersville store, the personal shoppers greeted her 6-year-old son with a treat from the bakery and a bottle of red Gatorade.
A short time later, Sherri Arrison, a retiree, arrived in her Nissan Murano. One personal shopper loaded groceries into the back, while another held out a bright orange umbrella to shelter the food from the rain.
“This is pretty much the only way I shop now,” Ms. Arrison said. “I don’t have to go into the store and keep walking around.”

",US Missile Machinations Undoes Non-Proliferation Efforts,"By Ulson Gunnar
When it comes to nuclear weapons upon the international stage, the general consensus is certainly not “the more the merrier.” Attempts to limit the number and variety of nuclear weapons and to take measures to avoid the use of those that do exist have been ongoing since the first nuclear weapons were developed at the end of World War 2.
Today, however, one of the several nuclear-armed nations of the world and its behavior has jeopardized the hard-fought progress made toward this goal.
America Reneged After the Cold War
One of several treaties singed during the later stages of the Cold War included the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABMT). It limited anti-ballistic missile systems to two per country. The reasoning was to hinder anti-missile technology development and leave nuclear-armed nations open to retaliatory attacks should they initiate a nuclear first strike.
The treaty helped further enhance the concept of “mutually assured destruction” (MAD). After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, member states upheld the treaty with the United States until 2001 when the United States unilaterally withdrew from it.
The White House in an official statement regarding America’s withdrawal from the treaty, would state:
…the United States and Russia face new threats to their security. Principal among these threats are weapons of mass destruction and their delivery means wielded by terrorists and rogue states. A number of such states are acquiring increasingly longer-range ballistic missiles as instruments of blackmail and coercion against the United States and its friends and allies. The United States must defend its homeland, its forces and its friends and allies against these threats. We must develop and deploy the means to deter and protect against them, including through limited missile defense of our territory.
However, the United States would spend the next decade and a half, not developing anti-missile systems aimed at stopping non-existent weapons of mass destruction launched from “rogue states,” it instead spent that time encircling Russia with anti-missile systems, including those placed in Eastern Europe.
In essence, the United States has begun to fulfill the sum of all fears during the Cold War, that a nuclear armed nation would attempt to monopolize missile defense technology and use it as a means to develop a nuclear first strike capability without fear of retaliation.
Opponents of America’s decision to withdraw from the ABMT noted that the move also undermined Washington’s own alleged nuclear non-proliferation efforts.
Russia Reacts
Articles like February 2017 New York Times piece titled, “Russia Deploys Missile, Violating Treaty and Challenging Trump,” attempt to portray Russia as menacing the US and its Western European allies with new and potentially “illegal” nuclear weapons.
The New York Times reports:
The ground-launched cruise missile at the center of American concerns is one that the Obama administration said in 2014 had been tested in violation of a 1987 treaty that bans American and Russian intermediate-range missiles based on land. The Obama administration had sought to persuade the Russians to correct the violation while the missile was still in the test phase. Instead, the Russians have moved ahead with the system, deploying a fully operational unit.
The article refers to another landmark effort made during the Cold War to reduce the likelihood of nuclear war, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by the United States and the Soviet Union.
Yet despite this narrative, the New York Times itself gives away what provoked Russia’s recent deployment of the missile system in the first place, stating (emphasis added):
The missile program has been a major concern for the Pentagon, which has developed options for how to respond, including deploying additional missile defenses in Europe or developing air-based or sea-based cruise missiles.
Clearly, Russia is responding to existing missile defenses the US has placed across Europe, or plans on placing across Europe in the near future.
As predicted by opponents of America’s 2001 decision to withdraw from the Cold War ABMT, America has undermined non-proliferation efforts, not only inviting other nations to discard efforts to rein in nuclear proliferation and the number and variety of nuclear weapons deployed by a nation, but in fact leaving nations with no other choice in the face of America’s own attempts to obtain a nuclear first strike capability.
NATO’s Expansion is a Lit Fuse
As NATO expands and as the United States digs in along Russia’s borders, a proverbial fuse lit by America’s withdrawal from the ABMT and its belligerence toward Russia ever since becomes shorter and shorter.
By provoking Russia into developing and deploying nuclear-capable intermediate-range missiles able to negate the possibility of a US nuclear first strike, the amount of time between launch and all out nuclear war has been significantly shortened.
Despite the US provoking this chain of events, instead of taking stock and retreating to a more sensible position, it is using Russia’s predictable reaction to rush even further forward. By posing a greater nuclear threat to Russia, the United States through its own irresponsible behavior upon the world stage encourages many other nations to pursue, develop and deploy nuclear armaments as a means of defense and deterrence.
While the United States poses as international arbiter of nuclear non-proliferation, it appears instead to serve as the premier provocateur of new nuclear weapons gold rush.

",Carter Page: I'll plead Fifth to Senate Russia probe,"Story highlights The FBI had obtained a warrant to monitor former Trump adviser Carter Page
Page has demanded an opportunity to testify publicly
(CNN) Former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page told CNN Monday he is going to plead the Fifth Amendment to keep from turning over a ""vast array"" of documents the Senate Intelligence committee requested, which he said is ""beyond the charter"" of the inquiry.
But Page demanded an opportunity to testify publicly before the panel, saying he offered to appear November 1 at the committee's open hearing on Russian attempts to influence the election through social media.
The committee has not responded to his request. A Senate intelligence spokeswoman did not immediately return a request for comment.
Page has been demanding the government release information about his communications that were picked up during surveillance operations. The FBI obtained a warrant to monitor Page on suspicions he knowingly engaged in clandestine intelligence activities on behalf of Moscow, according to an April report from The Washington Post
Page contends that he does not want to be caught in a ""perjury trap"" since the government has more detailed records about his communications.

The first inning of last night’s eventual Wild Card victory was a disaster. Luis Severino just did not have it and no one expected him to perform the way he did, least of all Joe Girardi. He gave up three runs and Girardi had had enough. What happened next actually ignited a Yankee team that I have not seen since 2009. The Yankees used all of its moving parts to battle back and beat Minnesota in an 8-4 win.

The Bucs got a single and GIDP off Edwin Jackson in the first while the Nats got a double, walk, single and wild pitch but only a run off Ivan Nova. The second went quietly with the Nats leaving a couple more runners on. Mad Max walked with an out in the third and Ivan got clunked in the hand trying to bunt. Steven Brault finished the at bat and then Chris Bostick and Starling went to work. Bo doubled in Max and Marte chased Bo home. Then Tyler Glasnow took the hill. He gave up a couple walks, one after being up 0-2, and a rap to tie the game. The Bucs spun their wheels. Glasnow tossed a quiet fourth, gave up a couple of hits but no runs in the fifth and was pulled after three walks in the sixth to set up a Victor Robles v Edgar Santana two-out, bases-filled duel. Santana won, getting a swinging K.

Following Georgia Tech’s 33-7 win over UNC, it’s still hard to tell just how good the Yellow Jackets are. To be fair to the Tar Heels, they are an injury depleted team that’s just plan bad. Georgia Tech controlled the game from start to finish. Last week Georgia Tech beat Pitt 35-17 and in week 2 they defeated Jacksonville State 37-10. Neither of those teams scare anyone.
Georgia Tech’s opening week loss to Tennessee even seems suspect as the Vols simply don’t look very good themselves. Still the Yellow Jackets are just 1 bad defensive quarter on that Labor Night from being 4-0 and ranked around 17th. Their UCF game was cancelled.
Here is the question… Is Georgia Tech good enough to be a threat in the Coastal? You just don’t know. They haven’t beat a team that I would describe as good yet, but minus the 1 bad quarter against Tennessee they’ve been in control of every game they’ve played. This is what I am sure of.
Taquon Marshall is an excellent quarterback. He reminds me of Tevin Washington. Washington always seemed to make the right read, and really knew how to run the offense. Marshall appears to be a more athletic version of Washington. The offense has sputtered from time to time, but for the most part has been pretty good. The defense is certainly improved.
Even against offensively challenged teams like Pitt and UNC, the defense has only given up 24 points. They are far better against 3rd down, and the tackling is better. This isn’t an elite unit, but it doesn’t appear to be the liability we’ve seen in years past.
The soft part of the schedule in now behind Georgia Tech, and the schedule really takes an uptick. In 2 weeks the Yellow Jackets play at Miami, and after that it is Wake Forest, at Clemson, at Virginia, Virginia Tech, Duke and Georgia. That’s 4 top 20 teams, and improved Wake Forest, Virginia and Duke teams.
The pecking order in the Coastal looks pretty clear. Pitt and UNC seem like the bottom of the Coastal. Miami and Virginia Tech are the top. Virginia is better, but not really equipped to win the Coastal. Duke is pretty good, but a notch below Miami and VT as we saw in their 31-6 home loss to Miami. Georgia Tech is the wild card in the Coastal, and I think a dangerous one at that.

With Odell Beckham healthy and scoring touchdowns again and the Jets actually winning a game, two of our defensive targets from previous weeks are not as viable as they once were. That doesn’t mean we can’t target either team, or that there aren’t any other teams to target, it just means we need to reevaluate our process a bit. Let’s take a look at how the defenses rank for this week:
Seattle Seahawks – vs. Indianapolis Green Bay Packers – vs. Chicago Cincinnati Bengals – at Cleveland Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New York Giants Tennessee Titans – at Houston Jacksonville Jaguars – at New York Jets Philadelphia Eagles – at LA Chargers Detroit Lions – at Minnesota Arizona Cardinals – vs. San Francisco Kansas City Chiefs – vs. Washington Pittsburgh Steelers – at Baltimore New England Patriots – vs. Carolina Miami Dolphins – vs. New Orleans Dallas Cowboys – vs. LA Rams San Diego Chargers – vs. Philadelphia
Notes:
Just because the Colts got into the win column last week and Jacoby Brissett has emerged as a sneaky, cheap, quarterback option, it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t target Indianapolis. While the Colts did score 31 points last week, it came against the 0-3 Browns and in three games Brissett only has three total touchdowns (one passing and two rushing). Last week was rough for Seattle as the Titans put up 33 points, but in the prior two games they allowed a total of 26 points. Seattle is not as strong of an option as they once were, they are still a solid defense with some of the same players from when they were a top defense off the board. The main issue is that need to create turnovers, with two interceptions. They will also benefit as the Colts have allowed 11 sacks, Seattle has six, which makes them one of the top plays this week.
It has been a forgettable start to the season for New England’s defense. Through three games they have given up an average of 32 points and 461 yards, and the initial thought would be to look the other way. The Patriots get what could turn out to be a gift this week as they face Cam Newton and the Panthers. I’m not sure how much that should count for since New England gave up 27 points to a rookie quarterback last week, but Newton has not looked good and was the first signal caller to struggle against New Orleans’ defense. If you are looking for positives, the Patriots did pick off DeShaun Watson twice last week and they have averaged two sacks a week. I have a hard time betting against New England, and if your streaming options aren’t great there are worse things than holding on. That is especially true, since there aren’t many slam dunk match-ups this week.
This isn’t about targeting the Jets as much as it is giving credit to Jacksonville. After almost shutting out the Ravens last week, perhaps the Jaguars defense is truly a legitimate fantasy option for this season. When they held the Texans to just seven points in the season opener while coming up with an interception, three fumble recoveries and scoring a touchdown, that was chalked up to Tom Savage more than anything else. It looked like the bounced back to earth in a big way by giving up 37 points to the Titans, but it’s hard to argue with the success they had last week. Despite the 20 points New York scored last week, they are still not an intimidating offense.

New Stanford study shows that a facial recognition algorithm can correctly determine whether people are straight or gay with up to 91% accuracy when using multiple images. Vin Armani covers the implications and fallout from the findings.
The study’s description states:
We show that faces contain much more information about sexual orientation than can be perceived and interpreted by the human brain. We used deep neural networks to extract features from 35,326 facial images. These features were entered into a logistic regression aimed at classifying sexual orientation. Given a single facial image, a classifier could correctly distinguish between gay and heterosexual men in 81% of cases, and in 74% of cases for women. Human judges achieved much lower accuracy: 61% for men and 54% for women. The accuracy of the algorithm increased to 91% and 83%, respectively, given five facial images per person.",0

",Catalan leader under pressure to drop independence,"BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia’s secessionist leader faced increased pressure on Monday to abandon plans to declare independence from Spain, with France and Germany expressing support for the country’s unity.
The Madrid government, grappling with Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981, said it would respond immediately to any such unilateral declaration.
A week after a vote on independence which the government did its utmost to thwart, the tension also took its toll on the business climate of Spain’s wealthiest region.
Three more Catalonia-based companies joined a business exodus from the region that has gathered steam since the Oct. 1 referendum.
Property group Inmobiliaria Colonial (COL.MC) and infrastructure firm Abertis (ABE.MC) both decided to relocate their head offices to Madrid and telecoms firm Cellnex (CLNX.MC) said it would do the same for as long as political uncertainty in Catalonia continued.
Publishing house Grupo Planeta said it would move its registered office from Barcelona to Madrid if the Catalan parliament unilaterally declared independence.
Spain’s finance minister said it was the Catalan government’s fault the companies were leaving.
Regional leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the regional parliament on Tuesday afternoon and Madrid is worried it will vote for a unilateral declaration of independence.
Catalan officials say people voted overwhelmingly for secession in the Oct. 1 referendum, which had been declared illegal by the government. Some 900 people were injured on polling day when police fired rubber bullets and stormed crowds with truncheons to disrupt the voting.
The issue has deeply divided the northeastern region as well as the Spanish nation. Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated against breaking away in Barcelona at the weekend. They say the referendum did not show the true will of the region because those who want to stay in Spain mainly boycotted it.
Buoyed by the show of support, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaría said on Monday: “I‘m calling on the sensible people in the Catalan government ... don’t jump off the edge because you’ll take the people with you.”
“If there is a unilateral declaration of independence there will be decisions made to restore law and democracy,” she told COPE radio station.
Underlining conflicting pressures on Puigdemont, the small, anti-capitalist Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP) party, which has an outsized influence on his government, said the outcome of the vote must be applied.
“We don’t want to hold up the declaration of the Catalan republic,” CUP lawmaker Benet Salellas told a news conference.
European heavyweights Germany and France weighed in against a split.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Saturday, stressing her support for Spain’s unity but encouraging dialogue, her spokesman said.
France said it would not recognize Catalonia if the region unilaterally declared independence. If secession were recognized it would lead to Catalonia’s automatic exit from the European Union, a French junior minister said.

“This crisis needs to be resolved through dialogue at all levels of Spanish politics,” France’s European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said.
The European Union has shown no interest in an independent Catalonia, despite an appeal by Puigdemont for Brussels to mediate in the crisis.
NEW ELECTIONS?
Under Catalonia’s referendum law, deemed unconstitutional by Madrid, a vote for independence in the assembly on Tuesday would start a six-month process envisaging divorce talks with Spain before regional elections and a final act of separation.
Rajoy gained some political cover on Monday for the so-called “nuclear option” of removing Catalonia’s government and calling new regional elections.
Opposition Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez said he would “support the response of the rule of law in the face of any attempt to break social harmony”, but stopped short of explicitly saying his party would back dissolving the regional parliament.

Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau advised Puigdemont against proclaiming independence on the basis of the referendum results and she urged Rajoy to rule out suspending Catalonia’s autonomy.
Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.
The crisis has reopened old divisions in a nation where the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco is a living memory easily revived by strong displays of nationalism.
A spokesman for the ruling People’s Party (PP) invoked the memory of former Catalan leader Lluis Companys, who was arrested for declaring independence in 1934 and later executed.
“We hope they don’t declare anything tomorrow, because anyone doing so might end up like him 83 years ago, in prison,” Pablo Casado told a news conference in Madrid.
Many moderate Spaniards, including in Catalonia, oppose a breakaway. Regional authorities say about 90 percent of votes in the referendum were for secession, but turnout was only 43 percent.
Sunday's anti-independence demonstration helped calm financial markets, as did credit rating agencies Moody's and DBRS which said they expected Spain to remain united. Spanish borrowing costs fell to a one-week low and the main share index .IBEX touched a week high.
Puigdemont appeared resolute on Sunday, saying the referendum law called for a declaration of independence in the event of a “yes” vote. “We will apply what the law says,” he told TV3.
Catalonia’s High Court asked for more security, specifically drafting in the national police, who were called in to stop the referendum when the Catalan police force failed to act.
Puigdemont said on Sunday he had not been in contact with the Madrid government for some time because it refused to discuss independence.
“What is happening in Catalonia is real, whether they like it or not. Millions of people have voted, who want to decide. We have to talk about this,” he said.
Rajoy has said repeatedly he will not talk to the Catalan leaders unless they drop their plans to declare independence.",1

One win doesn’t change the fact that the team is still rebuilding and trying to build a young core going forward. But through the first three games there are some trends that bear watching:
– The offensive staff has shown an ability to adjust on the fly to get the offense stabilized. Whether it’s been using 6-7 OLinemen to establish the run or TE & FB to chip pass rushers.
– The OLine (all 28 and under) has been very good in pass protection and improving in run blocking. And the fact that the staff has mixed and matched them in various aliments shows we may actually have depth.
– The TE position could actually be a big time strength with Seferian-Jenkins, Tye and Leggett (once healthy). The inline blocking of the position has surprised me.
– The acquisition of Kearse the continued development of Anderson and the flashes Stewart show give me hope for a nice corps of WR. But the staff MUST use Stewart & Hansen more, if we have those four and a healthy Enunwa next year we may have something.
– Forte looks slower than last year, Powell and McGuire need to be the primary RB’s going forward.
– Will the defense continue to stay true to their assignments? They absolutely detroyed MIA who has a lot of weapons and a good OLine just by doing their jobs. Can they keep it up? Because it’s amazing how good our ILB’s looked once everyone maintained their gaps and tackled. It’s also crucial because a sound defense allows Adams to be used all over the field as highlighted in Cimini’s article.

Film producer Harvey Weinstein emailed Hollywood associates asking for help to avoid being fired by his own company, US media report
Weinstein was sacked amid a slew of sexual harassment allegations dating back decades.
In the email, he said he was ""desperate"" for help and called for the film industry to support him, the New York Times reported.
Hollywood stars have spoken of their shock at the allegations.
'Heavy therapy'
Meryl Streep told the Huffington Post she was appalled by the ""disgraceful"" news and praised the women who reported the alleged abuse as ""heroes"".
Dame Judi Dench, who won an Oscar for her role in the Weinstein movie Shakespeare in Love, called the claims ""horrifying"".
The email was sent on Sunday to studio executives and agents, the New York Times reported, hours before Weinstein was fired by the board of his company.
According to those who said they had seen it, the email read: ""My board is thinking of firing me. All I'm asking is let me take a leave of absence and get into heavy therapy and counselling.
""Whether it be in a facility or somewhere else, allow me to resurrect myself with a second chance. A lot of the allegations are false as you know but given therapy and counselling as other people have done, I think I'd be able to get there.
""I could really use your support or just your honesty if you can't support me.""
The email adds: ""We believe what the board is trying to do is not only wrong but might be illegal and would destroy the company. If you could write this letter backing me, getting me the help and time away I need, and also stating your opposition to the board firing me, it would help me a lot. I am desperate for your help. Just give me the time to have therapy. Do not let me be fired. If the industry supports me, that is all I need.""
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Streep and Weinstein worked together on films such as The Iron Lady
Weinstein is one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, having co-founded the Miramax and Weinstein Company production firms. His films include Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and Pulp Fiction.
When the claims were first reported in the New York Times last week, Weinstein issued a statement in which he apologised for causing ""a lot of pain"".
However he later disputed the article, with one of his legal team claiming the newspaper's report was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"".
Weinstein's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said in another statement that the allegations against him were ""patently false"".
Bloom later announced she had resigned as Weinstein's adviser.
The allegations against him, according to the New York Times report, emerged mainly from young women hoping to break into the film industry and included celebrities Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan.
Among the accusations levelled against the film producer are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked. In return for sexual favours, he promised to help advance their careers, they said.",1

Miller was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. Follow him @aarondmiller2 . Richard Sokolsky is a non-resident senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . From 2005-2015, he served as a member of the Secretary of State's Office of Policy Planning. The views expressed in this commentary are their own.
(CNN) Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made a remarkable statement on Wednesday, rejecting reports he had considered resigning and reaffirming his commitment to the President's domestic and foreign policies. This was both stunning and unprecedented. It was not quite a hostage video, but it seemed awkward that a secretary of state felt compelled to defend himself in response to a press report.
Indeed, Tillerson has good instincts on many foreign policy issues and is ready to provide independent advice. But his road ahead won't be easy, particularly given that Donald Trump is ready and willing to undercut him.
Still, Tillerson clearly doesn't plan to resign, despite an NBC report that he referred to the President as a "" moron "" -- a claim his spokeswoman denies. And even if he did, it might not matter much who succeeded him. Unless the bureaucratic environment in Trumpland changes, his successor will likely confront the same challenges Tillerson is facing now.
So, what are these challenges?
First, our decades of experience in the Department of State allow us to report that the dynamic playing out now between the President and Tillerson has not existed before in modern US foreign policy history. Granted, Tillerson has not helped himself. He was not necessarily the President's first choice, lacks Washington experience, has an aversion to the media and has some misplaced priorities in how he has tried to reform the State Department.
But none of this can explain the current level of dysfunction that exists between the two. Secretaries of state and presidents have argued privately before over process and substance. But it's rare -- indeed unprecedented -- that these differences surface publicly. In the modern period, only two secretaries of state have resigned over principle: William Jennings Bryan in 1915, over Woodrow Wilson's policies toward Germany in the run-up to World War I, and Cyrus Vance in 1980, in opposition to Jimmy Carter's efforts to rescue the American hostages in Iran.
And that there is serious talk of Tillerson's resignation less than 10 months into his tenure is shocking. Since the 1950s, only two secretaries of state have had significantly abbreviated tenures: Edmund Muskie, who served out the remainder of Vance's term, and Alexander Haig, who left early because of inter-cabinet tensions generated by his brash style. While Muskie served just shy of a year, Haig served for a year and a half before his departure.
Second, that the President would mishandle and undermine his secretary of state at a time when the world is filled with foreign policy challenges -- indeed crises that require 24/7 focus and attention -- is also without precedent. And whatever Tillerson's flaws and failings, when it comes to matters of substance, such as recertifying the Iran deal, not picking sides in the Saudi-Qatar cold war, or probing diplomatic options on North Korea, his instincts are far sounder than the President's.
And yet Trump has consistently undermined -- even humiliated -- his top diplomat on these issues, most recently tweeting that Tillerson was wasting his time on North Korea. It would be one thing if the President were experienced in foreign policy or had other advisers who had both experience and influence on these issues. Both Secretary of Defense James Mattis and National Security Adviser HR McMaster have plenty of experience (though in national security and war-making -- not in diplomacy). But even their influence is limited.
President Richard Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger cut Secretary of State William Rogers out of many of the decisions on China and the Middle East. But they had the experience to make foreign policy decisions. Unfortunately, there is no other go-to person with diplomatic experience in Trump's administration.
Third, whatever responsibility Tillerson bears for his own misfortunes, he simply cannot function effectively as the nation's top diplomat unless the President makes it unmistakably clear that the secretary of state is his sole repository of authority and public voice when it comes to foreign policy. It takes Washington and the world all of five seconds to figure out when there's daylight between the two. And once that's established, you might as well hang a ""closed for the season"" sign on the secretary's door.
Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook
The truth is Trump has not even tried to grant Tillerson this kind of authority. In fact, he has done the opposite, assigning key foreign policy briefs to others -- such as Jared Kushner, who is charged with handling the Arab-Israeli negotiations -- and allowed individuals, including UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, to speak on a variety of issues -- from Iran to Syria -- as a de facto secretary of state.
Finally, we'd argue that even if Tillerson departed, it might not change much. The challenge for any secretary of state is the diminishing role of the State Department as the Defense Department and National Security Council play larger roles. (The other challenge is in confronting the cruel and unforgiving world, which has problems seemingly without solutions.)
But the real dysfunction begins at the top. And we wonder whether personal and substantive differences may have reached a point of no return. The combination of a thin-skinned President and reports like Tillerson's alleged ""moron"" comment, combined with substantive differences on a variety of foreign policy issues, may have compromised Tillerson's effectiveness.
We hope not. But we increasingly wonder whether there's really room for Tillerson in the volatile world that's Trumpland.",1

",Danish Police Recover Body Parts of the Journalist Kim Wall,"That contradicts Mr. Madsen’s account, in which he said Ms. Wall, 30, had died accidentally after a heavy hatch on the submarine’s tower collapsed on her head.
The divers, who were assisted by Swedish dogs trained to work in water, discovered the head and clothes in bags. Later, her legs were found attached to pieces of metal similar to ones found with her torso on Aug. 21, Mr. Moller said.

Police officers say they believe the metal may have been used to weigh down the body parts at sea.
The team also found a plastic bag containing an orange sweater and stockings belonging to Ms. Wall, as well as a knife. Mr. Moller did not say if investigators had linked the knife to the stab wounds found on the victim’s torso.
Mr. Madsen, who is in police custody, was informed of the latest findings, Mr. Moller said. The suspect’s lawyer, Betina Hald Engmark, did not respond to calls for comment on Saturday.

Ms. Wall’s boyfriend reported the Swedish journalist missing in the early hours of Aug. 11, after she did not return from her interview. The same day, Mr. Madsen was rescued from his sinking submarine.
The suspect initially said that Ms. Wall had gone ashore the evening of her visit. When officers found her blood in the recovered submarine and later retrieved her torso, Mr. Madsen altered his explanation, saying he had panicked and dumped her intact body at sea after she died.
During a pretrial detention review last week, the prosecutor in the case, Jakob Buch-Jepsen, presented an autopsy report showing that Ms. Wall’s legs had been removed with a saw and that she had been stabbed multiple times. Ms. Wall’s DNA was also found on Mr. Madsen’s hand, nostrils and neck.
The prosecutor also told the court that officers had found videos showing the torture and killing of women on a hard drive owned by Mr. Madsen. The videos did not appear to have been made by the inventor, but they indicated “an interest in fetish, torture and murder,” Mr. Buch-Jepsen said.

Ms. Wall, a freelance journalist, grew up in Trelleborg, in southern Sweden, and studied at the London School of Economics and at Columbia University.
Vishakha Desai, a professor at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia, said by telephone that Ms. Wall had been driven by empathy and a “curiosity to learn about people who might not be considered the mainstream.”

",CSX customers demand end to shipping bottlenecks as CEO apologizes,"FILE PHOTO: A CSX coal train (R) moves past an idling CSX engine at the switchyard in Brunswick, Maryland October 16, 2012. REUTERS/Gary Cameron/File Photo
(Reuters) - The head of No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp promised on Wednesday to improve service as companies like Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] demanded greater accountability and fewer delays, criticizing an overhaul CSX launched six months ago.
Customers have complained of longer transit times, unreliable switching operations, inefficient car routings and poor communications with CSX customer service.
Chief Executive Officer Hunter Harrison, who implemented cuts when he was appointed to the job in March, defended his strategy of “precision scheduled railroading” at a hearing at the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) in Washington.
The session marked the first public forum for shippers and trade groups to air grievances and give Harrison the chance to defend his strategy. The STB has been reviewing the railroad’s performance weekly and acting as intermediary between CSX and disgruntled customers.
Since he took over, Harrison closed CSX rail yards, lengthened trains, mothballed locomotives and slashed overtime pay and hundreds of jobs. He also changed the way rail cars are sorted in yards and replaced “unit” trains carrying a single commodity like coal or grain with trains carrying diverse freight.
He apologized to shippers for service disruptions, which he blamed on derailments and internal mistakes, including closing too many yards.
Speaking after Harrison, Cargill Vice President Brad Hildebrand asked the STB to publish minutes of its weekly calls with CSX management and asked CSX to return resources to its network.
“In a nutshell, (precision scheduled railroading) means having to do with less,” he told the regulators.
While some customers have noted improvements, others said CSX’s disruptions continue to create costly logistical headaches for companies from the chemical and agricultural sectors to the automotive industry and steel producers.
Their supply chains, plants and distribution channels rely on CSX’s rail network across the eastern United States.
Harrison said his strategy was critical to his previous turnarounds of two Canadian railroads - Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd and Canadian National Railway Co - and said, the “best is right around the corner.”
“We’ve made some mistakes. This is not a failure of precision scheduled railroading,” he said.
Harrison told the STB his turnaround plan has been implemented across CSX’s system but requires “fine-tuning.” He hinted at more possible layoffs and other yard changes.
Chemours Company asked the STB to require a “flight plan” from CSX outlining future system changes and how they will affect shippers.
In what could be a distant threat to CSX’s revenues, Chemours and trade groups renewed their calls for changes to federal regulations to allow shippers served by CSX to gain greater access to other operators.
Two trade groups asked the STB to require a service recovery plan from CSX with granular performance data and penalty-enforced deadlines.
Dow Chemical Co’s supply chain Vice President Greg Jozwiak urged the STB to improve rules to expedite relief during disruptions.
“The reality is the procedures take too long,” Jozwiak said. “We need a service remedy counted in days, not weeks or months.”",1
https://www.activistpost.com/2017/10/another-mass-shooting-another-grab-guns-6-gun-facts.html,"Another Mass Shooting, Another Grab For Guns: 6 Gun Facts","By Tony Cartalucci
 
Nothing is more deplorable than hijacking human tragedy to push an unrelated political agenda. A mass murderer taking the lives of some 60 people in Las Vegas this week has nothing to do with the majority of lawful firearms owners in the United States who aren’t and have no intention of ever killing another human being.
 
Yet the knee-jerk reaction of many emotionally-driven people in the face of an overwhelming tragedy is to shift public debate back to gun control and even banning guns altogether.
 
Emotional and irrational responses in the face of overwhelming circumstances is part of human nature and require patience.
 
Yet another part of being human is then appealing to our ability to reason. To reason we must have facts.
 
Upon examining the following 6 facts, we will see that access to firearms has no significant relationship to violence – and that violence is driven by another entire set of factors that must be addressed if we honestly want a more peaceful and prosperous world.
 
 
 
 
 
1. According to the FBI, more people die of barehanded assaults in the US per year than all rifle violence (“assault rifles” included) combined. In fact, homicide via personal weapons like hands and feet is more than double homicides carried out with rifles.
 
 
Most gun homicides are carried out by handguns in some of America’s most destitute communities where national and local governments have failed to keep up with infrastructure, providing education, or economic opportunities. Cities like Detroit who have had their industry shipped overseas and their infrastructure left to – in some cases literally – rot.
 
2. According to the Small Arms Survey conducted by the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland, the United States has the most guns per capita of any other nation on Earth at 112 guns per 100 people. Second place goes to Serbia at 58.21 guns per 100 people.
 
Based on this and assumptions that access to firearms equates directly to more violence, we would expect to find the United States and Serbia at the top of list regarding both homicides, and gun related homicides, yet this is not the case at all.
 
3. Highest homicide rate on Earth goes to El Salvador with 108.64 murders per 100,000 people. The United States comes in at number 94 with a murder rate of 4.88 per 100,000 people.
 
4. El Salvador’s gun homicides are at around 26.49 per 100,000 people while the US comes in with 3.60 gun homicides per 100,000 people. Honduras comes in first place with 66.64 gun homicides per 100,000 people.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nations topping the list of gun homicides together with total homicides reveal little relationship between the number of guns per capita and actual violence. In fact, despite the immense amount of firearms in the United States, the United States has a relatively low homicide and gun-related homicide rate. This is why gun ban advocates often attempt to cite “gun related deaths” which includes accidents and suicide instead of citing gun-related homicides – even when advocating gun bans after high-profile mass shootings and murders.
 
5. Gun ban advocates often claim the United States cannot be compared with “failed states” and instead should be compared with “advanced states” like Denmark, Sweden, etc. This is called “cherry picking” and is a logical fallacy, not rational or honest debate.
 
Neither El Salvador nor Honduras are “failed states” according to the Fragile States Index.
 
And neither Denmark nor Sweden have a “Detroit” like the US does. During a debate, all data must be considered, not conveniently and conditionally picked through so the numbers add up in one’s favor.
 
6. Despite the UK and Japan both being “gun free” – according the the United Nations (summarized on Wikipedia here) – the UK has a higher total number of murders (594) than Japan (395) despite having half of Japan’s population (UK: 65.64 million, Japan: 127 million).
 
For those tempted to claim that the UK isn’t actually gun free, realize that – according to USA Today – only about 50-60 murders a year in the UK are attributed to firearms, and if negated, still leaves the UK with higher total murders, and a still much higher murder rate than Japan.

Concluding Thoughts 
 
All 6 facts tell us that violence is driven by socioeconomic factors, not access to firearms. If firearms drove violence, the United States would be by far the most violent nation on Earth, followed by Serbia – they are not. The UK and Japan would have roughly the same rate of homicides – they do not.
 
 
If you truly care about a more peaceful world, address the root causes of violence – which is clearly, obviously not access to weapons. Those who intentionally stir hysteria and prey on the emotions of well-meaning people to push issues like gun control have ulterior motives – and coincidentally allow all of the actual factors that drive violence – socioeconomic disparity and destitution – to continue or even expand.
 
If you are truly against violence, you must truly commit yourself to understand what really causes it, and not indulge in emotional campaigns pursuing irrational measures that not only will not stop violence, but will invite great amounts of the very exploitation and injustice that drives violence.
 
Banning guns did not stop terrorists in Europe from obtaining completely illegal AK-47s used in Paris, France killing over 130 people, nor did banning guns stop a terrorist from using a truck in Nice, France to take the lives of over 80 people. Gun bans did not stop the alleged hijackers of the planes used on September 11, 2001 to kill nearly 3,000 people. They used box cutters.
 
Those who are determined to carry out premeditated mass murder like that which unfolded in Las Vegas, will do so no matter what implements they have at their disposal. Figuring out what factors actual cause an individual or organization to contemplate and carry out mass murder is the only way to stop or reduce future acts of violence.
 
Examining the heavily medicated, violent, and intentionally divided population of America and the socioeconomic doldrums they inhabit would be a good place to start.

",Disney's Tiffany Thornton defends remarrying two years after husband died,"(CNN) A former Disney Channel star has struck back at online commenters who are questioning her new marriage less than two years after her first husband died.
Tiffany Thornton, who starred on ""Sonny with a Chance,"" lost her first husband, musician Chris Carney, in a car accident in Hot Springs, Arkansas in December 2015.
Thornton married Carney, who starred on the MTV reality series ""twentyfourseven,"" in 2011 and the couple had two children together.
On Saturday Thornton married Arkansas worship pastor Josiah Capaci and called it the ""Best day of my life"" on an Instagram photo of her and her new husband.
Best day of my life 10/7/17 A post shared by Tiffany Thornton (@tiffthornton) on Oct 7, 2017 at 8:44pm PDT
Soon after that Thornton, 31, addressed the haters in the caption of another Instagram image of her and Capaci on their wedding day.
""This. This is love. That all encompassing, enduring, accepting, near perfect love,"" Thornton wrote. ""The kind that trumps my need to snap back at people who have the audacity to comment on my Instagram about whether I loved my first husband or not.""
This. This is love. That all encompassing, enduring, accepting, near perfect love. The kind that trumps my need to snap back at people who have the audacity to comment on my Instagram about whether I loved my first husband or not. But let me take a moment to explain something to you. There is no timeline for grief or for when God moves in your life in undeniable ways. There are a lot of people who think it isn't good to be transparent on social media but I say forget that. I'm going to be open and honest because God wants me to. It's part of my testimony and it needs to be said. I was a mess yesterday during our wedding ceremony. So many emotions flooded my heart as I walked down those balcony steps to the arms of my gift from God. I thought of Chris watching us and knowing he would have loved the choice I made, for me and for the boys. I thought of Chris's amazing parents sitting front row and how much of a blessing they have been and will forever be in our lives. How happy they are for the boys and I and how much they already love Josiah. I am so completely humbled by the love I receive from this man. Jo came along EXACTLY when God knew I needed him. It wasn't my choice to fall in love so quickly after chris passed but I was growing so comfortable with being alone that it was becoming unhealthy. Looking back now I think God saw that if I went too long without love that it would become increasingly difficult for me to submit to the authority of a husband after being set in my own ways. When I say ""Jo is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me"" that in no way indicates that I didn't love my first husband with all that I had. How dare any one of you judge me and say that on a social platform. It doesn't make you any better of a person to cast judgment on others and sit in the seat of mockers. I will always love chris and jo knows that. And I will always love Jo. The beautiful thing about love is that it multiplies as new blessings come into your life. I don't have to share one bucket of love with the special people in my life. Each one has their own bucket. Get it? Isn't that amazing?? God's timing is not our own. And I praise Him for that. You should too. A post shared by Tiffany Thornton (@tiffthornton) on Oct 8, 2017 at 6:49am PDT
She went on to say ""There is no timeline for grief or for when God moves in your life in undeniable ways"" and said she was extremely emotional walking down the aisle.
""I thought of Chris watching us and knowing he would have loved the choice I made, for me and for the boys,"" she wrote."" I thought of Chris's amazing parents sitting front row and how much of a blessing they have been and will forever be in our lives.""

""Looking back now I think God saw that if I went too long without love that it would become increasingly difficult for me to submit to the authority of a husband after being set in my own ways.""
Thornton called Capaci the ""greatest thing that's ever happened to me"" and said her new marriage ""in no way indicates that I didn't love my first husband with all that I had.""
""It doesn't make you any better of a person to cast judgment on others and sit in the seat of mockers,"" she said. ""I will always love Chris and Jo knows that. And I will always love Jo. The beautiful thing about love is that it multiplies as new blessings come into your life.""",1

",Rising number of children prey to deadly malnutrition in conflict-hit Mali: U.N.,"DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Tens of thousands of children in Mali are prey to life-threatening malnutrition as violence and displacement fuel a deepening nutrition crisis in the West African nation, the United Nations children’s agency (UNICEF) said on Monday.
About 165,000 children are expected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition across Mali next year - up from an estimated total of 142,000 during this year - according to UNICEF.
Those who suffer from the severe form of acute malnutrition see their muscles waste away, have very low weight for their height, and are nine times more likely to die in case of disease - such as diarrhea or malaria - due to a weakened immune system.
The rates of global acute malnutrition, the less threatening form, among children in the conflict-hit northern areas of Gao and Timbuktu have risen this year to above 15 percent, exceeding the emergency threshold set by the World Health Organization.
At least a tenth of children across Mali are suffering from global acute malnutrition, according to new government data.
“Behind these figures are the lives of the most vulnerable and forgotten girls and boys in Mali,” UNICEF representative Lucia Elmi said in a statement after the data was published.
“We must provide life-saving treatment and ensure each and every one of these children can fully recover,” Elmi added.
Violence in northern Mali has uprooted tens of thousands of people, disrupted health services and hindered access to water and sanitation, leaving even more children at risk, UNICEF said.
French troops and U.N. peacekeepers have been battling to stabilize Mali, a former French colony, ever since France intervened in 2013 to push back jihadists and allied Tuareg rebels who took over the country’s desert north in 2012.
“Efforts need to be intensified to build the resilience of families through improved food security, prevention and treatment of severe acute malnutrition, access to water and sanitation,” said Noël Zagré, a nutrition advisor with UNICEF.
Children must be closely monitored during their first three years of life - with families ensuring they are exclusively breastfed for the first six months and handwashing with clean water and soap - to prevent malnutrition, according to UNICEF.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/security-guard-las-vegas-gunman-unarmed/story?id=50290318,Security guard who found Vegas gunman was alone and unarmed: 'I was just doing my job',"An unarmed security guard at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino was the first to take on gunman Stephen Paddock, getting shot in the process, but providing crucial help for police looking to stop the massacre.
The security guard, identified as Jesus Campos by the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America, was shot in the leg after Paddock fired at him through a door, police said.
Police said Paddock managed to fire off over 200 rounds as the security guard approached the suspect's room alone. But the guard managed to direct police to the exact location of Paddock's suite and even provided a hotel key to officers looking to clear rooms on the 32nd floor before they insisted he get medical attention.
Reached by phone Wednesday night, Campos told ABC News, ""I'm fine.""
The guard who found the shooter and helped bring the massacre to an end said, ""I was just doing my job.""
Campos provided information over the phone that helped authorities locate the 32nd-floor room that Paddock was firing from, a spokesperson for the union said.
Drew Angerer/Getty Images
Campos was on ""random patrol"" as a security officer at the hotel when he found the shooter, said Liliana Rodriguez, who identified herself as a coworker of Campos' at Mandalay Bay on a GoFundMe page she set up for him.
""Any one of us could have been in the position he was in,"" Rodriguez wrote. ""Most importantly we are a home away from home and at the end of the day we are a team and we should all go home together.""
Campos was unarmed when he engaged with Paddock, the union spokesperson confirmed, which was first reported by The Daily Beast.
Speaking this evening, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo praised Campos, saying he aided officers in their search for Paddock.
Lombardo added that Paddock fired ""well over 200 rounds"" into the hallway when the security guard approached. Paddock had set up a camera in the hallway, apparently to watch for approaching authorities.
""It's amazing"" that Campos didn't sustain more injuries, Lombardo said.
""His bravery was amazing,"" Lombardo added. ""He gave our officers the key card for the room and then continued clearing rooms until he was ordered to go seek attention.""
On Sunday, about 22,000 concertgoers were attending the final night of the Route 91 Harvest Festival on the Las Vegas Strip -- across the street from the Mandalay Bay hotel -- when Paddock began his deadly assault.
It took authorities just minutes to locate where the bullets were coming from after the attack rang out. Once police breached the door to Paddock's suite on the 32nd floor of the hotel, they found him dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.
A total of 58 people were killed and 489 injured in the attack. A motive is still not known, but police said the shooting was ""obviously premeditated.""

Country singer Jason Aldean opened the second episode of the NBC variety series' 43rd season with a Tom Petty cover just days after playing as the mass shooting began in Las Vegas on Sunday.
""This week we witnessed one of the worst tragedies in American history. Like everyone I'm struggling to understand what happened that night and how to pick up the pieces and start to heal,"" Aldean said starting the show. ""So many people are hurting.""
Aldean took the stage of Studio 8H less than a week after performing at the Route 91 Festival in Las Vegas where the shooting took place. During his performance, gunfire rained down from the 32nd flood of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino across the streets, causing him to flee the stage.
The shooting injured more than 500 people and killed at least 58.
The singer, who was wearing all black including a black cowboy hat, added ""We hurt for you and we hurt with you, but you can be sure that we're gonna walk through these tough times together every step of the way.""

Aldean then went into a rendition of ""I Won't Back Down"" by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.
The song choice was even more poignant considering that Petty died Monday at the age of 66.
Aldean wrapped his set by looking at the camera and saying the series' iconic words, ""Live from New York... It's Saturday night!""",1

",Kaspersky works with Interpol; Kremlin dismisses claims against firm,"The logo of the anti-virus firm Kaspersky Lab is seen at its headquarters in Moscow, Russia September 15, 2017. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin
(Reuters) - Russian cyber security firm Kaspersky Lab said on Thursday that it has expanded its relationship with global law enforcement agency Interpol, agreeing to share threat data to help police fight cyber crime.
The company disclosed the agreement as the Kremlin dismissed claims by several U.S. newspapers that Israeli intelligence officials had determined that Russian government hackers were using Kaspersky’s software for espionage. The reports were the latest in a series alleging the company and its founder, Eugene Kaspersky, have close ties to the Kremlin.
Reuters has not been able to validate those claims.
Kaspersky has repeatedly said it has not helped Russia or any other government engage in espionage.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday the Russian government believes the allegations against Kaspersky are without merit.
He said that allegations, in articles in the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, were “absurd.”
”The government has not had and does not have any connection to such activity,“ he said. ”The accusations are ungrounded and unproven.”",1

",Gun control debate enters country music community,"(CNN) The massacre in Las Vegas was at once a national tragedy and a family one.
When Stephen Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival, he committed the largest mass shooting in America's history and struck at the heart of country music and its fans -- a community that often describes itself as family.
But in the wake of the tragedy in Las Vegas, some members of the country family are reflecting on the gun culture long associated with the music.
Plenty of debate
Since Sunday's massacre, debate has taken place on the airwaves at country music radio stations, around dinner tables and on social media over gun control.
Caleb Keeter is a guitarist for the Josh Abbott Band, which performed at the 91 Harvest Music Festival.
In a social media post on Monday, Keeter wrote that the tragedy had changed his views on guns.
""I've been a proponent of the 2nd Amendment my entire life,"" he wrote. ""Until the event of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was.""
Crew members on Keeter's bus had weapons and licenses to carry them, he said, but those ""were useless"" during the Vegas shooting for fear police would confuse them for the gunman raining bullets on the crowd.
""These rounds were powerful enough that my crew guys just standing in a close proximity of a victim shot by this f***ing coward received shrapnel wounds,"" Keeter wrote. ""We need gun control RIGHT.NOW.""
The late Johnny Cash was such a firearm aficionado that the National Rifle Association (NRA) shared the story of a Colt Model 1860 Army Revolver he is said to have given his friend, Gene Ferguson, on its site.
But Cash's daughter, singer Rosanne Cash, has been an advocate for increased gun control measures for 20 years. She called on more people in the country music community to join her in a New York Times column published Tuesday.
""I encourage more artists in country and American roots music to end your silence,"" Cash wrote. ""It is no longer enough to separate yourself quietly. The laws the N.R.A. would pass are a threat to you, your fans, and to the concerts and festivals we enjoy.""
Close ties to the NRA
As evidenced by Tennessee Ernie Ford's ""The Shotgun Boogie,"" Justin Moore's ""This Is NRA Country,"" or Hank Williams Jr.'s 2016 single ""God and Guns,"" country music, in countless songs, has showcased support for the Second Amendment.
Now more than ever give us God, Guns, and Freedom | New Country Music Video by CROSSWIND Band https://t.co/sLC17RrWPm via @YouTube #2A #NRA — Erin Lichnovsky (@ErinLichnovsky) October 4, 2017
And the NRA has worked to cultivate that.
The gun lobbying organization's NRA Country campaign features a roster of country music brand ambassadors, including Florida Georgia Line, Trace Adkins and Luke Combs.
""I kind see the similarities that run between what you guys do and what I do,"" Combs said in a video posted on the NRA Country site when he was selected to join the campaign last year. ""I enjoy going outdoors, shooting my guns, and stuff like that stuff.""
Combs, who performed at the festival in Las Vegas, announced he will play a song in honor of the shooting victims on an upcoming ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" show.
""Music is a healer,"" Combs tweeted. ""In this overwhelming darkness, I believe we will find hope when we rise together.""

Changing attitudes
Such platitudes are just what Courtney E. Smith wrote about in a Refinery 29 story titled, ""It's Time For Country Music To Change Its Tune On Guns.""
""If there was ever a moment for songwriters and fans of country music to reflect on where their personal rights to own a gun for hunting or protection end and where the rights of human beings to not be shot down in public begin, it is now,"" Smith wrote.
A Texas native who has been a music writer for years, Smith told CNN she was surprised by Keeter's change of heart on gun control, but she doesn't expect the industry will abandon its association with gun culture.
""There's no way there's going to be a massive cultural shift,"" Smith said. ""There's no way that everyone who is in country music is going to say, 'Yes, I'm giving up guns.'""
In 2015, country music superstar Tim McGraw was slammed by some fans for participating in a fundraiser for the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting.
""As a gun owner, I support gun ownership,"" McGraw said in a statement in response to the criticism. ""I also believe that with gun ownership comes the responsibility of education and safety -- most certainly when it relates to what we value most, our children. I can't imagine anyone who disagrees with that.""
Smith said that she believes attitudes in the country community will change ""one person at a time.""
That's not to say that some people aren't already there.
Take a good look
The country music fanbase is not a monolithic group of gun-toting advocates.
I am a fan of country music AND a believer in gun control. Why is there this much conversation over music preference ? — Elizabeth Miles (@BETTYMILES) October 4, 2017
Greg Bieck lives in Nashville and has worked as a country and pop music producer for almost 25 years.
He told CNN he would like to see the government step up and do more to curb mass shootings.
""It's not the wild West anymore,"" Bieck said. ""People have a lot of money tied up in these weapons, and I think it's worth it for the government to offer a buyback program for them. That would make everyone feel safe and be a win for both sides.""
Katie Toupal, a country music DJ in Minnesota, was present in Las Vegas during the shooting.
She told CNN's Brooke Baldwin Wednesday that she believes the tragedy will have an affect on attitudes in the country music family.
""I do think some people will take a second look at it [gun control], especially after so many tragedies and the biggest one we've seen in our time happening on Sunday night,"" Toupal said.
Dave Mann is a 31-year-old minister in Bellingham, Washington and a country music follower who considers himself to be a moderate when it comes to gun control.
He told CNN that while he doesn't expect fans or the country music industry to become anti-gun after the Las Vegas tragedy, he believes reflection is in order.
""I think we need to take a good look at ourselves in the mirror and ask if we want to be so strongly aligned with the gun industry,"" he said. ""Is this the kind of world we want to live in?""",1

",Hollywood reacts to Harvey Weinstein abuse claims,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dunham (l) and Larson (r) are among those to comment either directly or obliquely
Leading Hollywood figures have reacted to the New York Times' article on sexual harassment allegations made against film producer Harvey Weinstein.
The article reported he had reached at least eight settlements with women.
Girls creator Lena Dunham thanked one of its writers ""for pushing past [a] flimsy but firm veil of secrecy"".
Weinstein has disputed the newspaper report that claimed he harassed female employees over nearly three decades and is taking legal action.
'Reckless reporting'
The co-founder of Miramax and The Weinstein Company released a statement on Thursday in which he expressed ""regret [for] what happened"".
""I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologise for it,"" he wrote.
Weinstein, a married father of five, said he planned to take a leave of absence from his company and had hired therapists to deal with his issues.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Nicole Kidman is among the many stars with whom the producer has worked
Yet the producer of Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and other Oscar winners later said he was taking legal action against the paper for its ""reckless reporting"".
""This is a vendetta, and the next time I see [NYT executive editor] Dean Baquet it will be across a courtroom,"" he is quoted as saying by the Page Six website.
The 65-year-old has been married since 2007 to fashion designer Georgina Rose Chapman, with whom he has two children.
'I believe you'
Oscar-winner Brie Larson responded to the allegations by saying she stood ""with the brave survivors of sexual assault and harassment... as always"".
""It's not your fault. I believe you,"" she wrote in a post that did not mention Weinstein by name.
""The woman who chose to speak about their experience of harassment by Harvey Weinstein deserve our awe,"" wrote Dunham in another post.
""It's not fun or easy. It's brave.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm has offered concessions in an attempt to allay EU antitrust concerns over its $38-billion bid for NXP Semiconductors, the largest ever in the semiconductor industry.
Qualcomm, which supplies chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple, submitted its proposal on Oct. 5, a filing on the European Commission site showed on Monday, without providing details.
The EU competition enforcer, which suspended the deadline for its decision on Aug. 17 for a second time while waiting for information data from Qualcomm, said it would set a new deadline once the company has complied with its request.
The Commission is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers in the coming days. It is concerned the combined company may use incentives to squeeze out rivals and raise prices, as well change NXP’s intellectual property licensing model.

http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/28/opinions/is-sexual-jealousy-inevitable-in-relationships-fairyington/index.html,Opinion: Is sexual jealousy inevitable in relationships?,"Stephanie Fairyington (@Fairyington1) is a journalist in New York who writes on gender and sexuality. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.
(CNN) Showtime's provocative series ""The Affair"" follows the devastating aftershocks of an adulterous relationship between Noah Solloway (played by Dominic West), a married father of four, and a married waitress, Alison (Ruth Wilson). The mess that extends from their extramarital union includes the demise of two marriages, four troubled and bereft children, an unplanned pregnancy, an accidental homicide and an unjust incarceration.
Maura Tierney, who plays a deeply affecting Helen Solloway, Noah's abandoned wife, has said of the drama: ""My friends who are couples, don't like to watch it together."" As someone who struggles with sexual jealousy, which I believe is hardwired into us, I get why a couple might not want to preview the ugliness and suffering in store if they fail the expectation of fidelity. (Especially as it plays out on this show!) The thought of sexual betrayal alone can feel unbearable.
In an interview last summer, showrunner Sarah Treem put it this way: ""A romantic relationship is like a triangle where both people lean in, creating a structure that holds both of them up. If one person is quote unquote ""unfaithful,"" she said, ""the structure collapses. If your relationship is the primary thing that holds up your house, and for most of us it is, then it's terrifying.""
Author Dossie Easton, who co-wrote "" The Ethical Slut ,"" a guide to open relationships, has a less pragmatic and more philosophical -- and controversial -- take. She's long argued that sexual jealousy is a negative byproduct of the rigid expectations we've created around monogamy and marriage. She believes that the family structure would stay intact if we accepted our polyamorous natures and could ""unlearn"" sexual jealousy.
""Sexual jealousy is supposed to be somehow unconquerable and immovable,"" Easton told me. ""But that is a myth. It's really serious emotional work to unlearn jealousy and cultivate other ways to feel secure in a relationship, but it's possible. I've been doing it in my practice for the past 20 years and in my own life since 1969.""
Eminent family historian Stephanie Coontz's book "" Marriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage "" gives credence to Easton's claim. Coontz documents how marrying for love and expecting sexual fidelity for life is a fairly modern concept. Her research points to cultures across the globe and time, where people didn't exhibit signs of sexual jealousy in non-monogamous and non-romantic-love centric family structures. In ancient China, she reports, sisters recruited one another as ""back-up"" wives for their husbands. In Botswana, co-wives work with rather than against one another and value each other as mutual benefactors. ""Among Tibetan brothers who share the same wife,"" Coontz writes , ""sexual jealousy is rare.""
I wonder, though, whether it's simply not expressed in ways that are intelligible to Western ethnographers.
Surely, sexual jealousy is a multi-headed beast with origins unique to each individual's background, but I think the maniacal levels of jealousy many of us reach when romantic trust is threatened or broken is innate, and that it triggers our memory of the primal scene of abandonment -- birth -- the moment we were permanently severed from the oneness we knew in utero.
Two psychoanalytic theories formulated by contemporaries of Sigmund Freud -- Austrian psychoanalyst Otto Rank and Hungarian psychoanalyst Sándor Ferenczi -- support that view.
""In 1924, Rank published ' The Trauma of Birth ',"" Peter L. Rudnytsky , a professor of English at the University of Florida and head of the Department of Academic and Professional Affairs of the American Psychoanalytic Association, said in a recent interview with me. ""In it, he argued that the experience of separation from the mother's body is the primordial sense of loss that is recreated throughout the rest of one's life.""
If you think about it from an infant's perspective, Rank's theory makes sense: You're sweetly nestled in your mother's womb. Nine months later, you're pushed out into a new world that likely feels vast and cold in stark contrast to the one you formerly inhabited. The blanket they quickly wrap you in is a sad and incomplete substitute for the perfect unity you knew before being born. And it's a unity, according to Rank's peer Ferenczi , that you'll seek in vain to forge in sexual and romantic coupling for the rest of your life because sex is the closest we can ever come to recreating the experience of the womb.
Metaphors in popular culture and literature abound that bear out our desire to become a single unit with one another: Remember when Tom Cruise's Jerry Maguire tells his devoted assistant Dorothy Boyd (Renée Zellweger), ""You complete me""? Or, when singer Stacey Q croons on her '80s hit, ""Two of hearts, two hearts that beat as one."" Or, when Catherine Earnshaw in Emily Bronte's ""Wuthering Heights"" says of her childhood love, Heathcliff: ""Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.""
Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook
The inflammatory emotions that even the fear or suspicion of infidelity triggers may stem from the threat of losing the illusion of oneness we find in coupledom.
It may also conjure our infant vulnerabilities and post-birth fears of abandonment. As babies, we're the most vulnerable animals on the planet. If our parents don't feed, clothe, bathe, shelter and interact with us, we'll likely die. Given that romantic attachments re-enact the ones we had with our first loves, our parents, it's not surprising that the prospect of abandonment can feel, well, deadly. The sentient memory of our complete and profound dependence on our first caretakers follows us in every succeeding love relationship.
""The essence of love has to be the possibility of loss,"" Rudnytsky said, when asked what he makes of couples who are uncomfortable watching ""The Affair."" ""If we choose to commit to a faithful monogamous relationship freely,"" he added, ""then presumably we do so with the knowledge that it's not inevitable."" And that reminder, for many of us, is deeply unsettling.",1

",Trinidad and Tobago 2-1 USA,"Christian Pulisic has been a bright spark in the US's campaign but will have to wait at least another four years to make his World Cup debut
The United States failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986 after losing to Trinidad & Tobago and a controversial goal for Panama.
The US started the night in the third qualifying place but ended up fifth after losing 2-1.
Panama jumped up to third after an 88th-minute winner against Costa Rica to reach their first World Cup finals.
However, it was their opening goal that caused debate with Gabriel Torres' header not appearing to cross the line.
The 52nd-minute equaliser came from a corner with Torres' effort hitting the post and as Blas Perez tried to force the ball over the line, Ticos defender Ronald Matarrita looked to have cleared it.
However, despite complaints from the visitors, referee Walter Lopez of Guatemala gave the goal.
Honduras beat already-qualified group winners Mexico to also leapfrog the US and secure fourth spot in the table and a two-leg play-off against Australia.
The US beat Panama 4-0 just last Friday but, despite playing a Trinidad & Tobago side with just three points from nine games before kick-off, never looked close to securing a place in Russia.
""We had everything there for us,"" coach Bruce Arena said.
""We failed on the day. No excuses. We failed today. We should have walked off this field with at least a point. We should not be staying at home for this World Cup and I take responsibility.""
Omar Gonzalez stretched to cut out a cross and only succeeded in steering the ball past veteran goalkeeper Tim Howard, before Alvin Jones rocketed in a superb 35-yard strike to double the hosts' lead.
Borussia Dortmund teenager - and star of the win in Panama - Christian Pulisic gave the US hope soon after the restart with a fine long-range goal of his own, but with Honduras beating Mexico it looked like a play-off place for the States.
And then, with time running out in Panama City, Torres - who plays his club football in Seattle - latched on to a long ball forwards and smashed in off the crossbar to send Panama through and leave the US in the wilderness.
Centre-back Roman Torres was the hero for Panama with an 88th-minute winner
'The most surreal and embarrassing night in US soccer history'
In contrast to Panama, the United States has a population of 323.1 million. Their opponents on Tuesday, Trinidad and Tobago, have a population of 1.3m - roughly the same as the US state of Maine.
Described as the ""most surreal and embarrassing night in US soccer history"" and ""simply devastating"" by American journalists, the players were left in tears following their shock 2-1 loss.
This is the first time the US have failed to qualify for the World Cup since 1986
Captain Michael Bradley described the night as the ""perfect storm.""
""Everything that could have possibly gone wrong did, in this stadium and in two other stadiums across the region,"" he added.
""To give away the first goal like that [on an own goal] is a killer. But the reality is it was all there for us, and we have nobody to blame but ourselves.""",1

(Before It's News)
Show of hands: who expected a Ravens win in Oakland yesterday?
(spattering of hands)
Now who expected a 30-17 win, and Joe Flacco & Alex Collins to stay turnover free?
Liars!
It was an all around solid game by every facet of the team – even coaching! – with less concerning issues to talk about than we’ve become accustomed to in recent weeks.
Offense Grade Overall: B+ Quarterback: B+
The only reason I didn’t give Joe an A was due to his Red Zone presence, getting the Ravens into 1st & goal twice, only to walk away with a pair of chip shot field goals. In both instances Joe had an open receiver and simply missed him, but I guess the fact that he didn’t take a sack in either series, nor did he force it and create a turnover was a major improvement for Flacco. Speaking of turnovers – the streak is over! Flacco went without an interception for the 1st time since… like 2013 or something. It’s been a while.
Couple his clean game with deep shots of 52 & 54 yards, and you have 19/26 for 222 yards of beautiful game management by Joe.
Wide Receivers/Tight Ends: B+
This grade is a result of the disparity between the tight ends & wide receivers on the stat sheet but the tight ends deserve more credit for what’s not on the stat sheet.
While Ben Watson and Nick Boyle only combined for 3 catches for 11 yards, the biggest impact tight end was 3rd on the depth chart, Vince Mayle, who took the handoff around the left side to the pylon for the 1st Ravens’ touchdown of the day. Mayle never saw a target in the game, but I’m sure he was pretty satisfied regardless. The bigger contribution of the tight ends came off the stat sheets, as they spent the day chipping rushers – namely Khalil Mack – to help keep Flacco clean all day. They deserve partial credit for the fact that the Ravens didn’t give up a single sack.
The wide receivers have a better stat sheet to show on the day. Mike Wallace roped in catches of 54, 52 & 27 yards on the day, while Jeremy Maclin hauled in 6 catches on the day. And guess what???
BRESHAD PERRIMAN CAUGHT A BALL!
Two, actually, but glad to see he made the trip with the team!
Running Backs: A
A for Alex Collins, who held on to the ball all game long! It was noted by Trent Green in the broadcast that Collins was holding the ball higher and tighter than he had in the past, and it showed – 12 carries for 55 yards, a 25-yard scamper in the mix, and despite a few of his patented spin moves, he managed to hold onto the ball all game long.
Buck Allen also added 21 carries for 73 yards and a touchdown, along with 4 receptions for 12 yards. Another solid showing by the guy many thought was 53-man-cut-down-fodder before the Kenneth Dixon injury/suspension.
The only down note – Terrance West leaves the field early in the game with a calf injury. No word yet on how serious, but in this case, I guess no news is good news?
Offensive Line: A
Who knew the O Line would ever garner an A grade again this season??
After back-to-back weeks of awful play, the unit suddenly snapped out of the funk on the left coast, as they kept Flacco clean all day, giving him plenty of time. Of the group, Ronnie Stanley had the best look, allowing only a single pressure on the day, but the bigger impact came off the field, where the Ravens left tackle committed $1,000 to the victims of the Vegas massacre for every clean drop back by Flacco.
As such, Stanley is donating $26,000, which is such a great move by a great guy.

Defense Overall Grade: B Defensive Line: B+
Pressure! They got pressure!
Granted, the unit was not responsible for any of the 3 sacks collected by Baltimore, but they did manage to make EJ Manuel uncomfortable most of the day, while limiting his time in the pocket for the most part. Marshawn Lynch started hot, busting up the gut time after time and causing Ravens fans to tweet at Brandon Williams relentlessly begging for his return, but eventually, they were able to keep him in check (Marshawn’s TD was a result of a quick snap, nobody set, etc.).
Willie Henry with 2 deflections was a good look on the day.
Linebackers: B+
The Outside Linebackers had a great game in this one, creating disruption in the backfield, and keeping Manuel on his heels. Terrell Suggs with a sack, Matt Judon with a tackle for loss and surprisingly also played phenomenal in coverage!
Quite the contrary, C.J. Mosley had some issues with coverage, seemingly always a step behind. This is nothing new for C.J., but you’d hope he’d find a way to improve this aspect of his game.
Otherwise, a solid all around effort for the unit.
Secondary: B-
Again, a ton of disparity among the group.
Brandon Carr lost track of Michael Crabtree early in the game for a deep touchdown pass that he had no shot on, while rookie CB Marlon Humphrey got burned time and time again in this game against Crabtree. Lardarius Webb was also a liability in coverage in this game, although he made one great play: with Jimmy Smith scooping up a Jared Cook fumble heading for the end zone, Webby acted as a lead blocker, containing Raiders players to the inside leading the way to the TD. Speaking of Jimmy, he sat most of this game with an aggrivated Achilles, which is concerning, but if they can afford to rest him, do so!
The safeties had a great game too, as Anthony Levine had a sack, and Tony Jefferson with an absolutely bone-crunching sack of his own. The DBs as a whole held Manuel to 13/26 for 159 yards and 1 TD – 41 yards of which came on the TD to Crabtree.
I mean, nothing special to talk about here. Justin Tucker hit a few chip shot field goals when the Ravens couldn’t score from inside the 5, then hit a 3rd from 44 late to seal the victory. Morgan Cox had a pair of high snaps so, yanno, that’s not good.
Oh, and Koch shanked another punt. I’ve long said it – for every beauty he punts inside the 5 (he did that too yesterday), he shanks a bad one. Once a game. Pay attention Ravens fam.
Coaching: B
They did their jobs, Ravens Nation! They did their friggin’ jobs!
Dean Pees sent pressure all damn day, forcing Manuel out of his comfort zone, forcing early throws into coverage, or simply not allowing him to get the ball out. Even with a lead, Pees didn’t retreat and play it safe, as he continued his assault on the backfield. He sent linebackers, corners, safeties- you name it, he sent it!
On offense, we finally saw a return to the commitment to the running game, and it was effective. It opened up some deep routes for Flacco who finally was able to hit on his patented deep balls. The short game was utilized to keep pressure off of Flacco, plays weren’t called short of the sticks on 3rd down… just a solid showing by Marty!
The only gripe I’ll make is one we make weekly – the 2 minute drill is non-existent. Blame Flacco & the offense, but that’s a function of coaching shortcomings. I’d like to say I’d hope they improve upon it but let’s be honest – we’ve been asking for that for years now. It ain’t happenin’.
This was an all around team win by the Ravens, who managed to pick up their collective heads after 2 poor showings in the past 2 weeks, take a left coast trip where they usually struggle, and come away with a convincing win. I’ve said it before – EJ Manuel was not the reason they won. Derek Carr‘s averages in his 3 games were right in line with what Manuel managed this week. But this game for Baltimore, from the game plan (apparently they called the deep shot on the first play the day before the game), to the execution for 60 minutes was day and night from what we’ve seen.
Here’s to hoping for a continuation of this play and the subsequent results when they come back to Baltimore to face Da Bears next Sunday!

Signs of Rigidity
Our society is, in my opinion, well above average when it comes to rigidity compared to other Western democracies. We set rules and associated punishments for any wrongdoing we can predict.
You only have to look at driving signs in Sydney to see that. It takes a minute to read them. I think it might even be illegal to read them, such are the risks to your health and other road users’ health.
Who decides the rules, and who are the ‘risky’ subjects? You mentioned those of overseas cultures, but I would add Indigenous Australians and drug addicts to the mix. So often rules are made that make middle-class mums and dads feel safer and more assured, even though they and their families were rarely, if ever, affected by the activities the rules limit or outlaw.
— Ned Cooper
Larrikins United
I’m really surprised at your impression re. rule breakers versus rule followers. I break every rule under the sun, have done so all my life (I’m 66) and I think that pretty much all my peers do the same. So I guess it’s a matter of perception.
— Neil Bolton
Say No to Pregnancy
I had a two-month job as a visiting professor in the United States a couple of years back. The rules to get in for a non-American were astounding. As as woman of more than 70 years I had to insure myself against pregnancy, among other things, in order to be approved. I raised this as a patent absurdity and was told, don’t worry, it’s not discrimination, men have to get the same insurance.
The rule under no condition could be waived.

Personal Responsibility
I’m Australian and I’ve lived in Sydney for all 27 years of my life, though I like to think I am well traveled — don’t we all? I’m also a lawyer.

The reason Australians are sticklers for the rules, and the reason they are so hesitant to stray, is that they absolutely abhor the concept of personal responsibility in a way few other countries do.
If something goes wrong, it’s not the person’s fault. Rather, it’s that the regulatory framework for that arena of human behavior isn’t effective enough. More laws! Won’t someone please think of the children.

The best example I can think of was when, following a drunken man drowning in Circular Quay, the government proposed a fence. People actually agreed! Because of one drunk man. More mundane examples abound.
It is, in my opinion, one of the more distasteful aspects of Australian society.

Freedom!
I was in the butterfly house at the Melbourne Zoo with my daughter a few months ago admiring the elegant little creatures as they landed on the arms and shoulders of visitors. The beautiful delicate wings so full of colour when all of a sudden an Indian man grabbed a butterfly by the wings and starting waving the poor creature in front of his elderly mother’s face.
Maybe she was blind and he was just trying to let her see it close up but before I knew it I was saying “NO, NO, you cannot do that. You will hurt the poor creature.” Of course they didn’t really understand English that well so just thought I was scared of the butterfly until I started waving my finger disapprovingly like a butterfly lover in distress.
Afterward I did feel really bad, I felt terrible for making someone feel bad when they were just appreciating nature’s wonders, especially a visitor. Maybe it was the closet zoologist in me, who completed the degree but never worked a day in the field, trying to do my bit for animal conservation.
I found myself being extra polite as we passed each other many more times in the tight confines of an overcrowded butterfly house, insisting the elderly mother go before me as we both approached the exit.
I think next time I’ll try to resist the impulse and leave it to natural selection; the butterfly did fly off unharmed of course.

Immigrants Seeking Guidance
I think your daughter was right.
You should have, with the greatest of courtesy, drawn their attention to the “no feeding” rule. If they had been reasonable people they would have been grateful to you for pointing it out.
Speaking as a long-term immigrant to Britain, I can say through personal experience that often it is not a case of (usually newly arrived) immigrants not following the rules. It’s a case of not knowing what the rules are: standing in a queue, not throwing litter out of a car, not interrupting while someone is speaking, remembering to top and tail requests with “please” and “thank you.”
It is not that we have some fundamental objection to doing (or not doing) these things: It’s more that often we don’t know what needs to be done. Somebody please tell us — we want to learn, and through learning save ourselves some embarrassment!
— Vani K. Borooah
Rules and Images
Another interesting quandary I have encountered in my career as a teacher is of migrant families requesting a school for a white Australian blue-eyed blonde teacher for their child over a “brown” teacher — it makes for a proud display of the class photo to relatives back home, signaling they have finally “arrived” in Australia and raising their prestige in society.
Would this classify as a hangover of colonization, discrimination or market forces in the independent education sector, where if you are paying exorbitant school fees you can bend the rules to get what you want?
— Ipshita Nair
Don’t Rock the Boat
In not calling someone out on breaking the rules, it’s because it’s much less hassle and it’s being “too serious” and the rule being broken is “harmless.”
It’s just bread. It’s just food. It’s not a big deal. It’s just a couple of kilometers over the limit, it’s just some paper with your name signed on it and a label of “married.”

This extends from all manner of interpersonal interaction on the social and professional level all the way into our politicians — who are too busy calling each other names for a laugh than being serious for five minutes.

The problem is, we don’t really draw a line.
That’s because we can’t help but want to fit into the way our society runs — the casual, hands-off, “nah, she’ll be right mate” approach to everything that is so deeply ingrained in our culture that we struggle to care enough to change anything for fear of being called out — not for breaking the rules, but for disturbing the peaceful, carefree status quo we’ve established.
— David Tillett
‘Compliance Nation’
I am not suggesting that we become a nation of rule breakers but Australia is truly a “Compliance Nation” progressively getting worse. And unfortunately a general ambivalence by the population is letting it happen.

The Weinstein Scandal
A New York Times investigation that chronicled a hidden history of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein continued to ripple through Hollywood all week. By Sunday evening, his entertainment company fired him. Then new accusations emerged.
Several actresses have now come forward and spoken to or emailed my colleagues about their own experiences with Mr. Weinstein. “We’re at a point in time when women need to send a clear message that this is over,” Gwyneth Paltrow said. “This way of treating women ends now.”

(Before It's News)
The Jets won the game, but it wasn’t pretty. The Jaguars had plenty of opportunities to win the game, but Blake Bortles is a terrible QB, and the Jaguars have to be in the market for a good QB soon. Let’s look at some of the bad plays in the passing game.
1)
This play is a one outcome play, as the Jets have one route in mind and the rest of the team is tasked with blocking at first. The main purpose is to get the ball to Robby Anderson running down the field, and he is open for the pass. However, McCown doesn’t take the risk with the throw, instead choosing to run around the pocket until finding a safer option, which leads to a pass that nets negative yardage. This is probably one of the biggest issues with McCown, as he’s risk averse to a fault and doesn’t push the ball down the field when opportunities are present. The Jets caught the Jaguars in a bad defense for this deep route, yet still end up losing yards on this play.
2)
This is a third down pass that does not get a first down, because McCown makes the throw too early. The read on this play is the middle linebacker, especially since McCown has space inside the pocket to wait. When the tight end runs by the linebacker, that’s when the throw needs to be made, depending on the reaction of the linebacker. If the linebacker moves up for the running back, then the pass goes to an open tight end. If the linebacker follows the tight end backwards, there is more space for Kerley to run up the field. Instead, McCown pulls the trigger early, which allows the defense to collapse upon Kerley to prevent yards after the catch like a punt return.
3)
This play doesn’t count because there is a holding penalty on the Jets offensive line. However, note the risk aversion again from McCown. He has a wide open receiver running down the field and should be able to hit him for a sizable gain. However, McCown doesn’t pull the trigger and ends up running with the ball. This should have been a completed pass down the field. To hurt the cause more, the penalty happens after McCown decides to run, as the offensive lineman is trying to prevent the defensive lineman from running after McCown. Therefore, had he chosen to make the pass to the open receiver, the penalty would not have been called. This is a brutal miss by the Jets.
4)
The Jets are trying to rush down the field prior to the half to get some points, so some risk is warranted. However, McCown once again has a receiver running free down the field, and he decides to pass up on the option to get sacked. This should be an easy completion as soon as the receiver clears the linebacker in the middle, as you can see with him looking back towards the QB, expecting a pass. Another major missed opportunity by the Jets.
5)
The Jets are near the goal line and trying to score a TD, and McCown once again misses a wide open receiver. He makes a throw to a covered Jermaine Kearse, with Robby Anderson running free down the middle of the field. This is essentially a Fitzpatrick level pass because McCown focused in on Kearse from the start of the play and didn’t see Anderson at all. This could have been a touch down.
6)
This is a second and five play, and it almost goes for a pick six interception. The Jets have two safety options built into the route on either end to make easy completions. McCown does a good job of scanning the field, and finds Anderson open for the pass, but he can’t throw the ball with enough force and it’s almost intercepted. He doesn’t seem to see the safety in the middle at all, and it almost costs him. The decision is fine on this play, but he has to put more force behind this throw, or take the safety valve options because this is a fairly easy interception opportunity for the safety.
7)
On the outset, this is an unlucky interception. The pass most likely wouldn’t be intercepted if Bilal Powell doesn’t fall down. However, given the relatively clean pocket, this is another throw that is executed far too early. The Jets have a receiver cutting across the middle and Powell is the second tier option on the play. If the middle linebacker cuts towards Powell, then the receiver cutting across is open. If the middle linebacker goes with the receiver, then Powell will be building momentum with more space to run. Instead, McCown throws this pass early, which allows the middle linebacker to run towards the pass early, thus increasing the chance of Powell being stopped prior to the first down anyway. Since Powell falls down anyway, it’s a moot point, but this is also very bad execution on the part of McCown.
8)
Another Fitzpatrick level stare down of Jermaine Kearse, which almost leads to an interception.
9)
The Jets have a receiver going right down the field to the right side of the formation, with a defender trying to gain inside leverage, thus meaning a free release to the outside. Instead of taking a shot with the pass, McCown throws this pass up into double coverage to the other side of the field, with another pass that is lucky not to be intercepted. There isn’t much to be said about this, it’s just a bad decision.
10)
This is a play that has been analyzed over and over again. It’s pretty simple, McCown threw the pass early, which meant that Powell wasn’t ready for this pass, and it bounces away from him. The pass is a lateral, thus it counts as a fumble and it gets returned for a touchdown. The Jets are set up well to get some yards on this play with the screen pass, but McCown rushing it throws the entire play off.
Bonus:
1)
The play ends up being positive, but it seems like a very risky play with a low chance of a positive outcome. The game is tied, and the situation is 4th and 21, with 22 seconds remaining in the first half. The Jets need to execute a pass from a punter for 21 yards to have a chance for a possibly long field goal. An incomplete pass in this scenario would give good field position to the Jaguars with roughly 16 seconds remaining for a couple of quick plays. The throw is wobbly, and Marcus Williams makes a nice catch, runs around the defender, then runs into his own player, and somehow regains momentum to get the first down. The Jets of course seemed ill prepared for a positive outcome, as they promptly get a delay of game penalty and then miss the field goal. Most Jets fans probably don’t mind this call since the team is playing with house money, but this is a bad call for the situation. If there was more time to sustain a drive, or at least a couple of shots into the end zone, then it’s worth it. It worked out for the Jets but the distance and situation called for a safe punt.
Conclusion:
Josh McCown hadn’t won back to back games since 2004, a feat he accomplished with this win. Things that happened in 2004:
Britney Spears married Kevin Federline
The infamous Janet Jackson incident at the Super Bowl
FaceBook is launched
The last season of Friends
President Bush is re-elected
The Christmas tsunami
The Jets offensive system is actually encouraging because receivers are getting open, but the QB is missing them on a routine basis. McCown has a high completion percentage, mainly because he’s overly conservative with passes in critical situations.
Grade: C
If the Jets had faced a competent offense, this would have been a loss.
Forum Question(s):
A) What’s your opinion on the punt?

We're a quarter of the way through the season, and Brandon Marshall and the Giants are done, there are questions about Joe Flacco, and the Patriots defense is a mess. What is going on around here?
1. Giant Problems
I reached out to several Giants players this week, and the response I got was...interesting.
Nothing. Nada. Zip.
And these are guys who always text back. I tried one of the coaches, also a reliable respondent. Again, nothing. Seems the Giants have engaged their caterpillar drive.
This type of silence is usually a bad sign. It often means people don't want to talk because they might say too much.
The Giants are 0-4, and the chaos inside that locker room must be extreme. This is a proud organization that, unlike some other franchises, despises losing on a genetic level. These aren't the Chargers. Giants owner John Mara, the son of the legendary Hall of Fame owner Wellington, is a mild-mannered man but is as competitive a person as there is in football.
What's happened? This isn't a mystery to people around the league, who say they see an Eli Manning who looks old and an offense that doesn't have a lot of talent outside of Odell Beckham Jr.
The most scathing criticism, however, is focused on the signing of Brandon Marshall to be the team's No. 2 receiver. He was supposed to ease double-teams on Beckham, but he hasn't. Not even close. On the contrary, Marshall has hurt the offense significantly because of how much he has slowed down and how unreliable he has become as a pass-catcher.
""I think it's over for Brandon,"" one team executive told B/R. ""I think it was over for him last year.""
Marshall himself acknowledged he's ""just not playing well right now,"" per ESPN.com's Jordan Raanan. ""I haven't played a solid game since I've been here.""
Brian Blanco/Getty Images
To blame all the woes on Marshall, though, would be foolish. There is essentially a talent drain across the offense with the exception of one player.
The Giants haven't scored a single point in the first quarter this season and have trailed by at least 10 points in each game so far. Sometimes, the problem isn't all that complicated to diagnose.
The Giants don't make personnel changes easily. This is an organization that's had just three general managers since the 1980s. Still, most NFL team sources interviewed believe that if the Giants don't make the playoffs this season there will be massive overhaul of the coaching staff and possibly the front office. The franchise is loyal, but only to a point.
Mara isn't going to take kindly to a team that started 0-4 and didn't make the playoffs. He's patient and fair but not that patient and fair. And if the team loses this week to a winless Chargers club...hoo boy.
It may already be too late. Only one team ever has started 0-4 and made the playoffs: the 1992 Chargers.
""We've got to get that first win, and you go from there. You never know what can happen,"" said Manning, via James Kratch for NJ.com. ""We still feel like we're a good team that can win a lot of games.
""Well, let's make history and be the second team. That's the only thing we can worry about. ... Let's give ourselves a chance. No one knows what's going to happen, but if we don't start winning soon, we will know what's going to happen.""
2. Is Joe Flacco Still Elite?
Patrick McDermott/Getty Images
Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco long has been honest and blunt. It's one of many things I've always liked about him. And he didn't edit himself when B/R reached him after a loss to the Steelers in which he threw two picks and looked terrible, as he has for much of this season.
""I sucked,"" Flacco told me. ""I mean, you know, it wasn't good.""
Flacco finished with a 64.6 passer rating. But the truth is, Flacco hasn't looked good in a while.
Of course, Flacco isn't the sole reason for the Ravens' offensive woes. But he's the quarterback, and that means he gets most of the credit when the offense rolls, and the blame when it struggles.
And why has he struggled? I can't pinpoint one reason, based on interviews with players who have gone against him. But there is a general feeling that Flacco, while doing himself no favors, also hasn't been served by Baltimore's mediocre offensive weapons.
This isn't to say there are no options but that there's no Rob Gronkowski or Todd Gurley walking through that door at M&T Bank Stadium.
That is as big a problem for the Ravens as Flacco.
3. When in Baltimore, Do as the Raven Once Did
Many opposing players, when in Baltimore, now imitate the famous (or infamous) Ray Lewis celebration after they make a good defensive play. They mock it, actually.
But no one has explained why they do it as well as Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier, who mimicked the Lewis dance after he intercepted Flacco on Sunday.
""We're in Baltimore, and I wanted to celebrate Ray Lewis-style,"" Shazier said. ""Our goal is to be the No. 1 defense, and Ray Lewis has a great legacy of being a great defensive player. Plus, he always had a great rivalry with the Steelers. At the same time, I tried to make the home team a little mad, because it feels pretty good to win.""
4. Where Cooler Heads Prevail
Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images
After Ravens and Steelers players heard boos in Baltimore when some Ravens knelt and prayed before the national anthem played, both sides reacted in a manner that was measured and smart.
""We knew it was possible that we were going to get [booed],"" Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs said. ""We just wanted to show to our fans that we still do stand in solidarity. We don't want [anyone] to lose the narrative of why we're doing it. We don't want people to think that we're disrespecting the flag or military, or anything like that. It was pretty much that we still wanted to show solidarity.""
Said Ravens tight end Benjamin Watson: ""It's their prerogative to boo or not boo. Fans pay for their ticket, and they get to say what they want to say. We decided as a team to just have a moment of silence with everything that's going on. We wanted to pray for unity, we wanted to show the unity amongst each other, and that's what we decided to do.""
And after making news in Week 3 when he alone stood for the anthem outside the Steelers tunnel, left tackle Alejandro Villanueva tried to find some perspective after a tumultuous few weeks in the NFL: ""At this point, this whole kneeling or standing up is a much bigger issue than what we're asking for as a league. We're trying to be conscious of social issues. We're also trying to be respectful of the flag. ... I respect every single player in the NFL. Every single citizen has their rights. I am not into the politics of the game. I'm just a football player.""
5. Move the Chains, Win the Games
Stephen Dunn/Getty Images
The Eagles offense is rolling. It ranks third in total yards through Week 4 and seventh in points per game.
Why?
It is converting on third downs, that's why. It's (partly) that simple.
Against the Chargers on Sunday, the Eagles converted nine of 16 third-down opportunities, or 56.3 percent. The Eagles say that is the team's ninth-highest third-down conversion rate since 1991.
In 2017, Philly has converted 30 of 59 third downs, or 50.8 percent, and has been successful on at least 50 percent of their third-down attempts in three of their first four games of the season. The last time the Eagles accomplished that feat in as many games was in 1992 (all four games).
Move the chains, and you score points. Pretty easy to digest. And if the Eagles keep this up, they'll keep being hard to beat.
6. It's Elementary
Tim Warner/Getty Images
I'll get into why Deshaun Watson has been so good so fast soon, but first take a look at his passer ratings this season:
Week 1: 60.4
Week 2: 75.9
Week 3: 90.6
Week 4: 125.0
According to B/R research, the Texans quarterback became only the third rookie passer in NFL history with four or more passing touchdowns and one or more rushing touchdowns in a single game, joining Fran Tarkenton and Johnny Green.
It's early, and there will be bumps in the road, but clearly Watson gets it.
7. What Is Going On in New England?
Jim Rogash/Getty Images
Here's another gem from B/R research: The Patriots are the only team in the NFL to give up 250 or more passing yards in each of their first four games this season.
This has to infuriate Bill Belichick. Before anything, Belichick is a defensive genius, the best mind on the subject in the history of the sport. As the defensive coordinator for the Giants, he devised the scheme that stopped the unstoppable Bills passing game in Super Bowl XXV.
This is all a way of saying no one should expect the defensive woes of the Patriots to last long. Belichick won't let them.
8. Shields Up
The scene was incredibly odd. Marshawn Lynch, the Raiders veteran running back, took a seat on the bench during the anthem Sunday, as he has done before. This time, however, he was surrounded by team staffers trying to block the view.
Then Monday night, cornerback Kenneth Acker sat on the bench during the anthem, in protest, when one of his teammates attempted to shield him from an ESPN camera.
The motivation behind the shielding tactic is a mystery to me. My best guess is that players don't want images of them sitting used against them, but they also had to know that images of them sitting would be used against them.

One of the things scouts told me when linebacker Myles Jack came out of UCLA in 2016 was that his skill set would remind me of Hall of Famer Mike Singletary.
That's waayyyyyy too high a compliment for such a young player, of course. Singletary was a beast who destroyed running games.
Still, Jack is doing some amazing things in Jacksonville. This piece of data from Pro Football Focus says it all:
No, Jack isn't Singletary, but he's doing a nice impression.
10. A Question For You...
I'm going to ask a question. Don't get mad. Don't get snippy. Don't send me nasty notes. OK, here it goes.
This past week, two things happened that caused very different reactions in my social media nerd universe. The first was when Steelers receiver Antonio Brown beat the crap out of a Gatorade cooler. He was obliterated on social media for being a spoiled brat.
On the opposite end of the country, Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers completely wigged out. Rivers has done this before. He can be a petulant child.
On my Twitter feed I found two different reactions. It's anecdotal, but I think if you polled all sports fans they would have the same reactions. On one hand, Brown was considered a punk. On the other, Rivers was hailed as a competitor.
When Terry Bradshaw was going over highlights on Fox, he said this: ""The reason we're showing you this is to show you how selfish receivers can be. [Ben] Roethlisberger doesn't throw it to Brown. Brown pitches a fit. Acts like the spoiled brat that he probably is. And I'd sit him, I guarantee, for at least one play.""
So, now to my question: Why were the actions of Brown and Rivers viewed so differently?
Shoot me a note on Twitter, and I'll address this next week in this spot.
And be civil.

(Before It's News)
The best way to describe the win over JAX is an ugly, entertaining roller coaster ride. The Jet OLine was the major factor in this physical, “phone booth” game let’s take a look:
– A scrappy, feisty and resilient effort because there were plenty of opportunities to hang their heads. Is this team developing an identity?
– Have we seen the last of Matt Forte? With the dynamic performances of Bilal Powell and Elijah McGuire can the coaching staff really take reps away from them and give them to a 31 year old RB? What a pleasure to have RB’s that are always a threat to break off 50+ yard runs.
– Excellent game by the entire OLine as they dominated the JAX front and generated over 200 yards on the ground. Don’t let the sack stats fool you, at least 2-3 of those were because Josh McCown held the ball too long. And don’t forget Brent Qvale was subbing for Brandon Shell, credit to Steve Marshall (OLine coach) for having the backups ready to play.
– David Bass with another excellent game as he continued to bring edge pressure. He had a sack a TFL and did a good job setting the edge in the run game. Lorenzo Mauldin needs to take note as he recovers on IR.
– Kony Ealy with a huge impact game as he had 4 pass blocks and an INT that set up a FG.
– Leonard Williams with a nice game clogging up the run lanes and breaking down JAX OLine schemes multiple times.
– Josh McCown ended up with good “game manager” stats but he has to show better decision making. He held the ball too long on a number of occasions which led to sacks. And to me the scoop & score that made it 20-17 was his fault because he rushed the pass to Powell. After the 40+ yard bomb to Robby Anderson there was no need to rush the next play. Be conservative and run the clock there was no way Blake Bortles was going to generate two scores in the 4th quarter.
– Lachlan Edwards with a rollercoaster ride of a game. The lows were the short punt in OT that put JAX on the edge of FG range. And not being aware at the end of the first half that he needed to be on the field for the FG attempt which led to a delay of game penalty. Edwards was celebrating one of his highs, the fake punt pass as the clock was ticking down. The other high was the 70 yard punt which pinned JAX back inside the 5 yard line.
– Props to Chandler Catanzaro for the game winning FG but you can’t miss the kick at the end of the first half.
– Good follow up game by Demario Davis as he continued to be physical and laid some serious licks on Chris Ivory & Leonard Fournette.
– The self-inflicted wounds have to be eliminated because this team isn’t good enough to overcome them on a regular basis. Penalties in FG range, holding the ball too long for sacks and not being aware that you’re needed on the field can’t happen.
– Robby Anderson was relatively quiet because of the excellent play by AJ Bouye & Jalen Ramsey. But his speed is ridiculous because on the 40 yard bomb he torched Bouye with a simple stutter move.
– Blake Bortles stinks and his coaching staff knows it. They play around him hoping he doesn’t screw up the game.
– The Jets should send Marquise Lee a game ball as he had a huge drop in OT. And he then mishandled Edwards punt which put them inside the 10 yard line.

","North Korean Hackers Stole U.S.-South Korean Military Plans, Lawmaker Says","North Korea and South Korea have long had each other’s computer networks in their sights. The United States, piggybacking on South Korean operations, broke into the North’s computer systems in 2010, targeting the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the North’s equivalent of the C.I.A.
South Korean intelligence officials told lawmakers in June that Mr. Kim was desperate to get hold of South Korea’s decapitation plan. He had also begun using his deputies’ cars as decoys to move from place to place, they said.
When the hack was discovered last year, the ministry blamed North Korea. But it has acknowledged only that “some classified information” was stolen, saying that revealing more details would only benefit its enemies.
Some South Korean news media, citing anonymous sources, had earlier reported that the leaked data included wartime contingency plans. But Mr. Rhee is the first member of the parliamentary committee that oversees the military to disclose similar details.
It remained unclear how much the hacking has undermined the joint preparedness of the South Korean and United States militaries, with South Korean officials simply saying that they have been redressing whatever damage was caused by the cyberattack.
The military plans for dealing with North Korea have been rewritten in recent months by Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, in response to the North’s accelerated threats.
The plan containing the so-called decapitation operation, Operations Plan 5015, had been updated in 2015 to reflect the growing nuclear and missile threat from North Korea. Its details remain classified.

Under their mutual defense treaty, the United States takes operational control of South Korean troops in the event of war on the divided Korean Peninsula. The two allies hone their war plans through annual joint military exercises.

As Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, has accelerated his nuclear missile program in recent years, South Korean defense officials have publicly discussed pre-emptive strikes at critical missile and nuclear sites in North Korea and an operation to eliminate the North’s top leaders.
After North Korea’s sixth — and by far most powerful — nuclear test last month, the South Korean defense minister, Song Young-moo, told lawmakers in Seoul that a special forces unit with a task of removing Mr. Kim would be established by the end of the year.
Last month, United States strategic bombers and fighter jets also flew deep to the north along the east coast of North Korea in what some South Korean defense analysts said was an exercise to target the North Korean leadership in the event of conflict.
North Korea bristles at any threat to Mr. Kim, and a war of words has escalated between North Korea and the Trump administration. North Korea claimed a right to shoot down American warplanes flying in international airspace if they came near the country. When President Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last month, Mr. Kim vowed to “tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.”
North Korea runs an army of hackers trained to disrupt enemy computer networks and steal cash and sensitive data. In the past decade, it has been blamed for numerous cyber-heists and other hacking attacks in South Korea and elsewhere.
In the attack in September last year, later code-named “Desert Wolf” by anti-hacking security officials, North Korean hackers infected 3,200 computers, including 700 connected to the South Korean military’s internal network, which is normally cut off from the internet. The attack even affected a computer used by the defense minister.
Investigators later learned that the hackers first infiltrated the network of a company providing a computer vaccine service to the ministry’s computer network in 2015. They said the hackers operated out of IP addresses originating in Shenyang, a city in northeast China that had long been cited as an operating ground for North Korean hackers.
The intruders used the vaccine server to infect internet-connected computers of the military with malicious codes in August last year, the investigators said. They could also infiltrate the malware into intranet computers when the military’s closed internal network was mistakenly linked to the internet during maintenance.
The break-in by the United States into North Korea’s own government networks in 2010 was documented in classified materials released by Edward J. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor. The New York Times reported in 2015 that the penetration figured in quickly identifying the North Korean origins of the hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment.",1

",Scientist Calls “Check Mate” on Geoscience Misinformation Propaganda,"By Catherine J. Frompovich
Marvin Herndon, PhD, published another paper regarding global climate issues and ethics wherein he challenges the scientific community “to come clean” regarding their research, journals and ethics relative to weather science, which has garnered many titles: climate change, global warming, weather geoengineering, solar radiation management and who knows what it will become next in apparent attempts to confuse an awakening global population as to what’s been going on with geoengineered weather.
Source
Dr. Herndon’s paper “An Open Letter to Members of AGU, EGU, and IPCC Alleging Promotion of Fake Science at the Expense of Human and Environmental Health and Comments on AGU Draft Geoengineering Position Statement” was published in the New Concepts in Global Tectonics Journal, v. 5, no. 3, September 2017. www.ncgtjournal.com.
Dr. Herndon believes “Scientists are persons of integrity: They stand for what is right. They tell the truth and ensure that the full truth be known. They do not lie.” He’s definitely a holdover of “old time” scientists who don’t subscribe to what’s become known as “consensus science,” a pseudoscientific clan-like or religious-like approach to propagandizing special vested interests’ scientific agendas and ‘confirming’ study results for various reasons, e.g., financial gains; go along to get along; not be subjected to peer pressure; or not bear the brunt of being professionally ostracized!
Being an interdisciplinary scientist, Dr. Herndon earned degrees in physics and his PhD in nuclear chemistry. He’s no dummy! Additionally, he did post-doctoral work in geochemistry and cosmochemistry at the University of California, San Diego. As such, Herndon has continued his research into the current hot button climate change issue, since he alleges fake science is being promoted in science journals, which he contends needs to be challenged and corrected.
To illustrate Herndon’s point, he says this in his recently published paper:
Numerous AGU members along with members of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the European Geosciences Union (EGU) have been involved in failing to tell the full truth about climate change. These scientists promote the claim that greenhouse gases, most especially anthropogenic carbon dioxide, are responsible for global warming. They remain silent about the consequences of the daily, near-global aerosol geoengineering that has been taking place since at least the 1990s with growing scope and intensity [4]. Failure to discuss this massive global anthropogenic phenomenon not only negates the validity of these scientists’ assertions about climate change, but, I allege, makes those individuals, and their associated institutions, party to the biggest science scam ever perpetrated. And, as well, party to an activity many may consider to be a crime against humanity and the environment [5]. For 70 years the military interest in controlling the weather has been thoroughly documented [6]. Military experiments advanced from causing rain and snow to inhibiting rainfall by emplacing pollution particles into the atmosphere where clouds form. Eventually, the atmosphere becomes too moisture-laden and torrential rains and storms result. The net effect of the now near-daily, near-global ongoing covert geoengineering activity of emplacing pollution particles into the atmosphere is to contribute to global warming. While some sunlight is reflected back into space by aerosols, the deliberately spread pollution particles also heat the atmosphere and impede heat loss from Earth [4]. The albedo of snow and ice is lowered by certain particulates when they fall to Earth. There is, furthermore, evidence of a covert operation to deliberately melt ice by dispersing pseudo-cryoconite material [7]. [CJF emphasis]
However, in this writer’s opinion, this statement by Dr. Herndon is a KEY concern regarding the issue of consensus science not only in climate control but in every aspect and genre of ALL the sciences, specifically microwave technology, medicine, pharmaceuticals and vaccinology:
High-ranking and some other members of the AGU, EGU, and IPCC have been grossly remiss in ignoring the ongoing aerosol geoengineering. Not only are their climate-science results corrupted, but those scientists, who are unwilling to consider the evidence for ongoing climate engineering, demonstrate an absence of concern for human and environmental health. [CJF emphasis]
Dr. Herndon challenges
The draft Geoengineering Position Statement is a tainted document that not only fails to tell the truth but is produced by a panel composed of at least two individuals, Ken Caldeira and Marcia McNutt, who, I allege, have a documented track record of acting to deceive the scientific community and the public about the existence of and the adverse human and environmental health consequences of ongoing tropospheric particulate aerosol geoengineering. No one has the right to poison the air we all breathe, and no one has the right to hide the health risks from the public. The ongoing military aerosol geoengineering program has been conducted without public disclosure. [CJF emphasis]
Dr. Herndon’s insightful concerns reflect those of many conscientious scientists, millions of observant citizens and possibly even some politicians when he says,
Instead of being a body of scientists who are willing and able to provide independent scientific advice to the U. S. Congress, the National Academy of Sciences, I allege, has been corrupted and coopted to serve a political agenda that may be characterized as tyranny against human populations that involves crimes against humanity [5]. As the adverse health consequences of the current ongoing geoengineering become public, perhaps the legal community will instigate class action lawsuits. The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad) No one has the right to poison the air we breathe and no one has the right to deceive the public of the adverse health risks involved in clandestine geoengineering. Not even the military has this right. [CJF emphasis]
When will consensus sciences finally be denigrated to the dustbin of Corporatism and legally be prosecuted under the RICO statute [the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] of the U.S. federal government?

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was taking an indefinite leave from the Weinstein Co, the film production company said on Friday, adding it will conduct an internal investigation into the New York Times’ report of sexual harassment allegations against one of the most powerful men in Hollywood.
The Weinstein Company board of representatives said in a statement that it takes “extremely seriously” the accusations made in the Times story that said Weinstein had made eight settlements with women who had accused him of unwanted physical contact and sexual harassment over three decades.
Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and several Democratic politicians including Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer said Friday they will re-route Weinstein’s political donations to women’s rights groups.
Weinstein Co board representatives called it “essential” to company culture “that all women who work for it or have any dealings with it or any of our executives are treated with respect and have no experience of harassment or discrimination.”
The company said it has retained an outside legal firm to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations.

Weinstein, 65, will take an indefinite leave of absence, the company said. His brother Bob, a co-chairman, and chief operating officer David Glasser will lead the company.
“As Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged. Next steps will depend on Harvey’s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the Board’s independent investigation, and Harvey’s own personal decisions,” the board representatives added.
Weinstein initially responded to the Times story on Thursday by apologizing for causing anyone pain, and saying he was taking a leave of absence.
His lawyer later threatened to sue the New York Times.
Weinstein, one of Hollywood’s best-known figures, has produced or distributed Oscar-winning movies including “Shakespeare in Love” and “Chicago.” He was a prominent donor to Democrats during the 2016 general election campaign.
“The DNC will donate over $30,000 in contributions from Weinstein to EMILY’s List, Emerge America and Higher Heights because what we need is more women in power,” DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement.",1

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - French energy conglomerate Engie SA (ENGIE.PA) has appetite for more Brazil acquisitions, and will evaluate assets being sold by Eletrobras, despite spending more than $1 billion in a licensing auction last week, Engie’s local unit head told Reuters on Wednesday.
Brazil’s state-controlled utility Eletrobras, or Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA (ELET5.SA), said on Monday it will soon kick-start its divestiture plan which includes stakes in dozens of projects, mostly wind parks and power transmission ventures.
“We are open to opportunities, but always conservatively and with financial discipline,” Mauricio Bahr, Engie Brasil’s chief executive, said in an interview in Sao Paulo. “But our debt in Brazil is low so we have some room.”
“We would have to look asset by asset,” Bahr said, adding transmission lines could be of interest.
Brazil’s power sector is going through a process of consolidation, with many local players putting assets up for sale to cut debt as credit is tight. Brazil’s government has tried to attract foreign capital to help boost the economy by selling operating licenses for several projects.
Engie spent 3.53 billion reais ($1.13 billion) last week in a government-sponsored auction to win licenses to operate two large hydroelectric power plants in Brazil.
The assets will boost local operations which already contribute 18 percent to the company’s global results.
Engie and Eletrobras are partners in several projects, including the massive Jirau hydroelectric dam, a plant built in the middle of the Amazon jungle with capacity to generate 3,750 megawatts.
Eletrobras has hinted it could sell stakes in its large Amazon plants. Besides Jirau, it is a shareholder in Belo Monte and Santo Antonio dams.
“I don’t know if they (Eletrobras) will want to sell Jirau, it depends on their appetites. But eventually it will be natural for the partners, who have the right of first refusal, to end up exercising it,” Bahr said.",1

SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military flew two strategic bombers over the Korean peninsula in a show of force late on Tuesday, as President Donald Trump met top defense officials to discuss how to respond to any threat from North Korea.
Tensions have soared between the United States and North Korea following a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test in recent weeks as it fast advances toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.
The two U.S. Air Force B-1B bombers were joined by two F-15K fighters from the South Korean military after leaving their base in Guam, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement on Wednesday.
After entering South Korean airspace, the two bombers carried out air-to-ground missile drills in waters off the east coast of South Korea, then flew over the South to waters between it and China to repeat the drill, the release said.
The U.S. military said in a separate statement it conducted drills with Japanese fighters after the exercise with South Korea, making it the first time U.S. bombers have conducted training with fighters from both Japan and South Korea at night.
The U.S. bombers had taken off from the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. In August, Pyongyang threatened to fire intermediate-range missiles toward the vicinity of Guam, a U.S. Pacific territory that is frequently subjected to sabre-rattling from the North.
GUARD RAISED
South Korean and U.S. government officials have been raising their guard against more North Korean provocations with the approach of the 72nd anniversary of the founding of North Korea’s ruling party, which fell on Tuesday.
Trump hosted a discussion on Tuesday on options to respond to any North Korean aggression or, if necessary, to prevent Pyongyang from threatening the United States and its allies with nuclear weapons, the White House said in a statement.

Trump was briefed by Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford at a national security team meeting, the statement said.
U.S. and South Korean wartime operational plans, including a plan to wipe out the North Korean leadership, were stolen by North Korean hackers last year, a South Korean ruling party lawmaker said on Wednesday.
Some 235 gigabytes of military documents were taken from South Korea’s Defense Integrated Data Center in September last year, Democratic Party representative Rhee Cheol-hee said in radio appearances on Wednesday, citing information from unidentified South Korean defense officials.
In May, an investigative team inside the defense ministry announced the hack had been carried out by North Korea, but did not disclose what kind of information had been taken.

SHIPS BANNED
The United Nations Security Council, which has imposed a series of ever tighter sanctions on North Korea, has banned four ships from ports globally for carrying coal from North Korea, including one vessel that also had ammunition.
The vessels are the first to be designated under stepped-up sanctions imposed on North Korea by the 15-member council in August and September over two long-range ballistic missile launches and Pyongyang’s sixth and largest nuclear test.
China, North Korea’s main ally and trading partner, has consistently argued sanctions alone will not work, urging Washington and Pyongyang to lower their rhetoric and return to the negotiating table.
China’s influential Global Times tabloid expressed alarm at how far the rhetoric on both sides had gone and how it had increased the risk of a “fatal misjudgment”.
“The international community won’t accept North Korea as a nuclear power. North Korea needs time and proof to believe that abandoning its nuclear program will contribute to its own political and economic advantage. This positive process is worth a try,” the paper said in an editorial late on Tuesday.
“War would be a nightmare for the Korean Peninsula and surrounding regions. We strongly urge North Korea and the U.S. to stop their bellicose posturing and seriously think about a peaceful solution,” it said.",1

ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government called on Tuesday for confidence votes in the lower house of parliament to try to force through an electoral law that is likely to penalize the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
The new voting law, which would be used in a national election due by next May, is backed by the ruling Democratic Party (PD), former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) and the anti-migrant Northern League.
Unlike the current rules, the new system, known as the Rosatellum, would allow the formation of broad coalitions before the ballot, a factor likely to hurt the maverick 5-Star, which refuses to join alliances.
The party, which tops many opinion polls, says the Rosatellum could cost it up to 50 seats in parliament. It has called for protests on Wednesday, when the lower house is due to hold two confidence motions. A third vote is set for Thursday.
“This is a mortal blow to democracy, a violation of democratic laws,” said Luigi Di Maio, the 5-Star’s candidate for prime minister. “The aim is to destroy us.”
Italy’s political landscape is highly fragmented and successive governments have failed to reduce the nation’s huge debt mountain and struggled to revive the economy. Investors fear political instability here could undermine the euro.
President Sergio Mattarella, the only figure with the power to dissolve parliament, has demanded new voting rules be drawn up because at present there is too much divergence between the systems for electing members of the two houses of parliament.
Previous efforts at reform have all ended in failure thanks to a matrix of conflicting interests. The latest version offers a mix of first-past-the-post and proportional representation, and gives party leaders a huge say over nominating candidates.
Although the Rosatellum will likely hurt 5-Star, analysts say it looks unlikely to throw up a clear parliamentary majority, with opinion polls showing the center-left, center-right and 5-Star splitting the vote three ways.
A government is obliged to resign if it loses a confidence vote so only deploys the motion if it thinks key legislation might get held up or radically altered without its intervention.
In this case, the government motions will sweep away dozens of secret votes on various aspects of the law, which would have allowed disaffected parliamentarians from the traditional parties to sink the bill, as happened in June during a prior attempt to introduce new electoral rules.
The ruling PD dismissed accusations that it was subverting democracy, saying there would still be one final secret vote on the whole package.
“In this secret vote we will see if the law is good or bad,” said Ettore Rosato, the parliamentary party leader of the PD who has put his name to the reform.
“This is the last chance we have to put in place an electoral law and we want to avoid, just weeks ahead of the ballot, any traps,” he told reporters.
Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni hopes to get the bill through the lower house of parliament by the end of the week, after which it will go to the upper house Senate, where the government has no clearly defined majority.",1

BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s anti-graft watchdog said roughly 1.34 million lower-ranking officials have been punished since 2013 under President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption drive.
Xi, who is preparing for a major Communist Party leadership conference later this month, has made an anti-graft campaign targeting “tigers and flies”, both high and low ranking officials, a core policy priority during his five-year term.
China is preparing for the 19th Congress later this month, a twice-a-decade leadership event where Xi is expected to consolidate power and promote his policy positions.
Those punished for graft since 2013 include 648,000 village-level officials and most crimes were related to small scale corruption, said the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) on Sunday.
While much of the country’s anti-graft drive has targeted lower ranking village and county officials, several high-ranking figures have been taken down.
In August the head of the anti-graft committee for China’s Ministry of Finance was himself put under investigation for suspected graft.
In September a senior military officer who sits on China’s powerful Central Military Commission, overseen by Xi, was detained and questioned over corruption-related offenses, Reuters reported.
The CCDI said 155,000 country-level party bureaux have set up corruption policing mechanisms as of August, representing 94.8 percent of total bureaus.

The tie-up marks only the second joint venture between the Pemex and a equity partner since an energy opening finalized in 2014 ended the company’s decades-long monopoly and allowed it to develop projects with private and foreign oil companies.
Cardenas-Mora is a 65-square-mile (168 sq km) field located in Tabasco state believed to contain 93 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in proven, probable and possible reserves.

Our hearts and prayers go out to all those killed or injured in the Las Vegas shooting, and in a nation where so many anti-Americans are kneeling in pampered protest, this mass shooting saw veterans and police officers standing up, helping the victims and heading straight for the shooter to take him out. Real Americans don’t kneel, they stand and get to work to save lives. Today I offer tremendous gratitude to all the first responders who helped save lives and stop the violence.
 
Although the news reporting on this shooting is still in its early stages, there are five strange things that just don’t add up about this massacre (so far). I run through them below.
 
#1) Dozens of concert-goers reported the presence of multiple shooters
 
Although law enforcement says there was only one shooter, multiple witnesses are openly reporting the presence of multiple shooters. This could reasonably be the result of confusion and chaos, but it’s also highly suspicious that the shooter had “full auto” weapon which is usually limited to law enforcement or military personnel.
 
This question about multiple shooters was also raised after the Aurora, Colorado “Batman movie theater” shooting, in which numerous witnesses reported the presence of multiple shooters.
 
If this shooting was carried out by multiple shooters, it would obviously indicate planning and coordination among a group of people who sought to carry out the shooting for a political purpose of some kind.
 
#2) Who warned concert-goers they were “all going to die” a full 45 minutes before the shooting started?
 
Via the UK Express:
 
One woman, who was at the Route 91 music event, claimed an unidentified woman had told other concert-goers they were “all going to die” after pushing her way to the front of the venue.
 
The witness, 21, told local news: “She had been messing with a lady in front of her and telling her she was going to die, that we were all going to die.
 
“They escorted her out to make her stop messing around with all the other people, but none of us knew it was going to be serious.”
 
She described the lady as Hispanic. The lady was escorted from the venue along with a man.
 
The unnamed witness, who was attending the event on her 21st birthday, described the pair as short, both around 5 ft 5ins to 5ft 6ins tall, and looked like “everyday people”.
 
It’s clear that neither of these two people were the shooter, as the shooter is a much taller Caucasian man. Thus, this is not a “lone gunman” massacre. There was coordination. At least three people were aware this shooting was about to take place.
 
#3) The weapon you hear on videos was FULL AUTO, which is almost impossible to acquire through legal means
 
The multitude of videos that captured the event clearly indicate that at least one shooter was running a full auto weapons system. Such weapons are almost impossible for “civilians” to acquire. Although some pre-1986 full auto weapons are available for sale, they require extensive ATF documentation, background checks and extremely long wait periods approaching one year. Plus, they tend to cost $25,000 or more, and they’re extremely rare.
 
Full auto weapons, however, are widely owned by police officers, federal officials and military organizations. It will be very interesting to find out where this weapon came from and how it was acquired.
 
#4) Why were the exits blocked, trapping victims like rats in a maze?
 
Numerous reports from witnesses who were on the scene reveal that nearly all the exits were blocked. One witness described the situation as “being caught like a rat in a maze” with numerous “dead ends.”
 
Why were nearly all the exits blocked? In essence, the concert created a kill zone that amplified the casualties. So far, according to the Clark County Sheriff in Vegas, 515 people have been injured and 59 people have so far died. These are unthinkable numbers, approaching war-time casualty counts. It’s clear from the coverage that this shockingly high body count would not have been possible if people had been free to flee the concert venue.
 
In essence, the concert trapped the people, preventing them from escaping, and denying them the ability to seek cover. From there, sustained, full-auto gunfire is almost impossible to survive.
 
In addition, once the shooting started, the stage lights were turned to the crowd, lighting up the crowd and making them an easier target for the shooter(s). Was this deliberate?
 
#5) Why did the shooter have as many as 10 firearms in his room?
 
According to news reports, the shooter — identified as Stephen Paddock — had as many as 10 firearms in his room, including several rifles. If he was the only shooter, what’s the point of having so many rifles? One man can obviously only shoot one rifle, and since he had a full auto rifle, he could obviously achieve his evil aims by focusing on his one rifle. There was no need for him to have multiple rifles.
 
So were the other rifles brought to the room to “stage” the crime scene with an abundance of guns? Why would one elderly man bother to carry 8 – 10 weapons to a hotel room in the first place? That’s a lot of work. Rifles aren’t lightweight devices.
 
I find the idea that a lone, elderly man would carry so many rifles to a hotel room for no practical reason to be highly suspicious. It makes no sense at all.
 
 
ONE MORE QUESTION: Why is ISIS claiming responsibility for the Las Vegas massacre?
 
Via Reuters:
 
Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a shooting that killed at least 50 people and wounded over 400 in Las Vegas early on Monday, and said the attacker had converted to Islam a few months ago.
 
“The Las Vegas attack was carried out by a soldier of the Islamic State and he carried it out in response to calls to target states of the coalition,” the group’s news agency Amaq said in reference to the U.S.-led coalition fighting the group in the Middle East.
 
“The Las Vegas attacker converted to Islam a few months ago,” Amaq added. (Reporting by Ali Abdelaty; Writing by Arwa Gaballa; Editing by Ahmed Aboulenein)

Deputy Interior Minister Roberto Campa said all the bodies had been recovered from the ruins of an office building in the upscale Roma district of the capital. The search at other buildings that collapsed ended several days ago.
In total 369 people died in the Sept. 19 earthquake, the most deadly in a generation, with almost two-thirds of the fatalities in the capital. Earlier that month, 98 people died when an even more powerful tremor hit the south of the country.",1

The response time of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department during a recent mass shooting has been called into question by an Iraq War Veteran who claims he told police exactly where the suspect, Stephen Paddock, was firing on concertgoers, which was above his room in the Mandalay Bay casino.
 
Chris Bethel told reporters he was staying in a room just a few floors below Paddock and notified police to the mass murderer’s precise location. Now, Bethel is demanding an answer to the question as to why it took the LVMPD Swat team 1 hour and 12 minutes to penetrate Paddock’s room to neutralize the threat.
 
According to a timeline produced by the Daily Mail, the first reports of gunfire at the Route 91 Harvest Festival came in at 10:08 p.m. Bethel claimed he called the police to let them know from which floor and room the shooter was firing from. He is now miffed with incredulity that it took police 72 minutes to enter the room, only to find that Paddock had reportedly taken his life.
 
“It felt like it took them too long to get over there, to take him out…to get him. And it’s actually eating me up inside,” Bethel said.
 
Recognizing the types of weapons being used, and the presence of explosives, Bethel described what he heard:
 
I could just hear gunshots, continuously. Just full automatic,” Bethel said. “There were explosions going off. It was like a bomb just went off man. And then there were more gunshots.”
 
 
 
 
 
Bethel said he called the front desk to tell them where the shooter was firing from but no one answered the phone. All the while, he could hear the shooter changing calibers and weapons as well.
 
“Seconds are going by, minutes are going by, the rounds are continuously going,” Bethel said. “Changing weapons, changing calibers, you can hear the difference in the gunshots.”
 
He told reporters as he watched the police attempt to locate the shooter’s room, he noticed they were going in the wrong direction. Eventually, he was able to get someone on the phone to tell them, “He’s not over there. He’s over here!”
 
The first look into the officers’ view during the shooting was revealed after Body Camera footage was released on Tuesday, showing the sheer chaos and terror at the scene as they searched for the shooter.
 
 
According to the Daily Mail’s timeline, LVMPD admitted they knew of Paddock’s exact location at 10:24 p.m., but they delayed in storming the room and taking out the suspect. It was not until 11:21 p.m. that the SWAT team used explosives to blow their way into the room, only to find Paddock reportedly deceased from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Bethel said he is filled with regret about the fact that it took LVMPD over an hour to get inside the room.
 
“I feel like I didn’t do enough,” he told CBS DFW. “I feel like I couldn’t get a hold of somebody quick enough to let them know. And it felt like it took them too long to get over there, to take him out.”
 
In all, 59 people were killed and 527 injured in the attack now known as the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. But LVMPD has not always been so slow to respond to reports of armed and dangerous individuals.
 
In 2010, LVMPD officers were called to the Costco in Sumerlin because concealed carry permit holder and West Point graduate Erik Scott had been seen carrying a concealed handgun in his waistband. It took LVMPD less than 15 minutes from when they received the call from Costco security until they arrived on scene.

After they confronted Scott at the entrance to the Costco, they shot and killed the man many said was attempting to comply with their commands. Not only was he not brandishing a weapon and not firing upon innocent shoppers, but he had his arms raised above his head when he was struck by officers’ bullets with one piercing his heart.
 
The fact that the LVMPD was so quick to respond to the call to a local warehouse club where a man was threatening no one and yet, were so slow to take action while an active shooter was mowing down hundreds of partygoers, has not gone unnoticed.
 
While the gun grabbers are quick to push their unconstitutional initiatives to take away the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms, some criticism should be reserved for a police department that arguably dragged its feet. According to Bethel, they could have truly saved lives by responding much sooner and taking action immediately after they were given the location where Paddock was firing from.

Time to revive the long forgotten Dunderhead of the Week award in recognition of the spectacular stupidity of Ospreys’ hooker, Scott Baldwin.
The 29-year-old Baldwin missed his team’s latest Pro14 fixture against the Cheetahs because he had been BITTEN BY A LION WHILE TRYING TO PET IT.
The incident happened during a team trip to Weltevrede Game Lodge on the outskirts of Bloemfontein, where everyone was – appropriately enough – warned not to put their hands into the lion’s den.
As Ospreys’ coach Steve Tandy points out, “You can’t pat a lion on the head as if it’s a kitten.”
And yet that’s exactly what Baldwin did. One word:Dunderhead.

",Careers for Women in Technology Companies Are a Global Challenge,"Karoli Hindriks, 34, of Estonia, started her first company when she was 16. At 19, she spoke before the European Parliament about young entrepreneurs. And she didn’t consider herself a feminist.
“I thought, if you’re good enough, you’ll get the position,” she said. Then, she was propositioned by a possible investor. Writing about the episode in her blog, she described it as “the most humiliating situation imaginable.” She also said that when she was applying for an accelerator program for the company she currently heads, Jobbatical, she was told she should leave the fact that she had a child off the application. (Jobbatical matches global companies and job-seekers in technology, business and creative fields.)
“I was very full of myself when younger,” she said. “It has been eye-opening.”
But one thing making her life easier is “that the state is supporting family so strongly,” Ms. Hindriks said. “We have 18 months’ paid paternity and maternity leave. Preschool costs nothing. Taking care of a child is not an issue.”
Geraldine Le Meur, 45, moved from Paris to San Francisco a decade ago to be, as she put it, “in the center of the jet engine. It was and is the place to be when you are in the digital and tech space.”

One the biggest cultural differences she found is how surprised people were that, as a mother of three, she opted to work full-time.
“It was almost shocking to people that I continue working rather than stay at home with the boys,” said Ms. Le Meur, who started the Refiners, a San Francisco-based seed fund program to help foreign tech start-ups go global. “It wouldn’t be the same in France; it wouldn’t be that surprising.” And she also attributes the differing attitudes to state-subsidized day care and to an earlier starting age for school – 3 years old rather than 5 in the United States.
“You know that the people taking care of your babies while you work are professionals,” she said. “I see friends here who have little kids who are super-conflicted. If they’re financially well-off, it doesn’t seem right not to take care of the kids yourself. My kids are the best part of my life, but not the only part.”
Shira Kaplan, 34, who moved with her husband from Israel to Zurich for his job, found that the message about combining motherhood and work was very different in Switzerland than in her native Israel. She served in the elite cybersecurity intelligence unit in the Israeli military, but when she became pregnant with her first child while working at a private Swiss bank, she said she was constantly asked: “ ‘Are you coming back? Are you coming back 100 percent?’ In the end, they restructured my team while I was on maternity leave and it was a very strong signal.”
She then started and now runs Cyverse, a firm that brings Israeli cybersecurity expertise to Europe. Yet, even as the industry is increasingly eager to show diversity by bringing on women — “we’re the new hot thing” — she still feels different, not just about being a woman, but a young woman, she said.

In Israel, perhaps because military service is mandatory for women and men, there is a greater sense of equality, she said, and there are more women entrepreneurs in technology. In Switzerland, walking into a technology conference, “almost everyone one around you is a gray-haired male in a suit,” she said. “It’s difficult, because when doing business with someone, you look for something in common, and we’re asymmetrical — ‘I’m young, they’re old, I’m a woman, they’re male, I’m short they’re tall.’ ”
Ms. Imafidon, 28, agreed. “I’m young, a person of color, a woman and I talk like a person from East London — you could discriminate against me for a number of reasons.”
She said she hasn’t experienced much gender bias, probably because, she said, she is very confident and not especially perceptive about what other people think of her. At 20 she was one of the youngest people ever to be awarded a master’s degree in mathematics and computer science by the University of Oxford, and in 2013 the British Computer Society, a professional organization, named her its young information technology professional of the year.

But she is worried about the small number of young women entering the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, collectively known as STEM, and the messages they’re getting about women in technology.

Her concern led her to start Stemettes, which offers workshops, classes and summer programs designed to expose all girls and young women to science, technology and engineering. For example, at a recent event, 60 girls ages 5 through 19 showed up to build their own apps.
The different educational systems in the United States and Britain mean that each has its own strengths and weaknesses when teaching STEM, she said; British schools, unlike schools in the United States, have a national curriculum; STEM teaching in the United States, on the other hand, “might be more patchy, but it can also be more creative.”
Vanessa Evers, a professor of computer science at the University of Twente in the Netherlands who was a visiting scholar at Stanford University and who worked for Boston Consulting Group in London, said the United States offers more women role models in technology and science than her country does. “In America, it is easier to find support,” said Prof. Evers, who specializes in human-computer interactions. “I had women mentors who were willing to allow me to be there to observe and come along to important meetings. I learned so much just from being there. It’s not so common here — there’s more of a class system, a sense that ‘you don’t crash the party.’”
She feels, she said, a “basic condescension” as a woman in tech. “I feel I have to convince them that I know the technology, and they’re surprised when I do.”
Prof. Evers has had her share of inappropriate remarks and experiences, she said. One time, a more senior male colleague was interested in whether she shaved her armpits and pulled at her shirt to take a look.",1

European captain Thomas Bjorn expects England's Tyrrell Hatton to be in his Ryder Cup side next year after watching him defend his Dunhill Links title.
Hatton, 25, missed the cut at all four majors this year, but won his second European Tour title by finishing three shots clear of Ross Fisher in Scotland.
Bjorn believes the High Wycombe player can ""achieve great things"" in the game.
""He's a wonderful player and he's got a great attitude towards the game,"" Bjorn told BBC Three Counties Radio.
""He's aggressive in his mind, he wants to achieve things and sometimes that might come across like people think he's too aggressive, but that's what you want from your players.
""You want young players that want to get out there and be the best they can be.""
The 2018 Ryder Cup will take place at Golf National on the outskirts of Paris from 28-30 September, with Bjorn selecting four wild cards to join the eight automatic qualifiers.
Hatton - who would be making his debut if he faces the US in France next autumn - is at the top of the early points table, with the qualifying period beginning just over a month ago.
He began the final day of the Dunhill Links on the Old Course five shots ahead of the field and fired a six-under 66 to retain his title on 24 under.
""Performances like his at the weekend are very special and for the very few,"" Bjorn said.
""He really has risen and become a player that has a very good chance of not just being there [at the Ryder Cup] in 12 months, but in general has a good chance of achieving great things.""",1
http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-41503664,Athenia: Is this the wreck of the first British ship torpedoed in WW2?,"Image copyright GSI Image caption The sonar contact matches the dimensions of the Athenia in all details
The remains of the first British ship to be sunk in WW2 appear to have been identified on the Atlantic seabed.
Shipwreck-hunter David Mearns says sonar data shows the transatlantic passenger liner Athenia to be lying 200m down on Rockall Bank, off Ireland.
A German submarine torpedoed the ship hours after Britain declared war on Hitler in 1939 - more than 100 people, including many Americans, were killed.
Germany initially denied involvement fearing the US would join the war.
U-boat commander Fritz Julius Lemp had mistaken the liner for an armed cruiser and the German naval authorities tried to cover up the sub's actions.
They even attempted to blame the sinking on Winston Churchill, who on that very day - 3 September, 1939 - was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty.
The Germans said he had ordered a British submarine to fire on the Athenia as part of a plot to force Washington's hand. The full truth only emerged at the Nuremberg Trials.
Athenia: Timeline to a disaster

Chamberlain's famous ""this country is at war with Germany"" broadcast was delivered shortly after 11 in the morning. The torpedo from U-30 struck the Athenia at 7:38 that evening. She was slow to go down, disappearing beneath the waves, stern first, at 11 the next morning.
Image caption When she left Liverpool on 2 September, three-quarters of her passengers were women and children
David Mearns, who has found some two dozen major wrecks for insurers and TV companies, says the Athenia's hull is visible in sonar data acquired by the Geological Survey of Ireland. It is split in the aft section where the torpedo hit, but otherwise is sitting proud of the sediment and looks to be in reasonable shape.
To the untrained eye, sonar imagery can be difficult to interpret, but Mr Mearns says the dimensions of the target match exactly what would be expected of a 160m-long, 13,500-tonne passenger liner. What is more, the coordinates are very close to those sent out by the Athenia's radio officer in his distress call, and recorded in the logbooks of the vessels that came to the rescue.
""Can I go into a court of law and say, '100%, that's Athenia?' No. But barring a photograph I can say in my expert opinion there's a very, very high probability that that's Athenia. Everything fits,"" said Mr Mearns, who sets out the case in his book The Shipwreck Hunter.
Wasted pursuit
The relatively shallow water on Rockall Bank, an area of raised seabed a few hundred km from the Irish coastline, means it should be reasonably straightforward to send down a remotely operated vehicle to investigate the sonar contact.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Mearns: ""My research rules out all other shipwrecks in this area""
The marine scientist first got involved in the search for the wreck in a commission from the BBC. Producers had wanted to stage a live, underwater broadcast from the sunken remains of a famous ship.
In the end, the TV idea was dropped, but Mr Mearns still hopes an expedition can be mounted by someone.
It is the first wreck in his consultancy career ""which I've identified from my armchair, so to speak"".
Searching the seafloor for sunken ships in this way is usually a wasted pursuit because of the dearth of high-resolution sonar data.
""The Moon and Mars are mapped to a greater degree of accuracy than our seabed. Our own inner-world is largely unexplored,"" Mr Mearns told BBC News.

He is now involved in efforts to change this. His expertise means he has been appointed as a judge on the Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE, a $7m incentive to get engineering groups to develop innovative seafloor mapping technologies and strategies.
Lifeboats smashed
These new approaches would help achieve an international goal set last year to have 100% of the topography of the world's ocean bed mapped by 2030.
""It would be at such resolution that anyone could look for shipwrecks like the Athenia from their desk. That's the ultimate goal, anyway,"" said Mr Mearns.
Image caption The Athenia still draws interest because of the many stories associated with the sinking
The Donaldson Atlantic Line SS Athenia was built in Glasgow and the city's Riverside Museum of transport has an exhibition dedicated to the vessel and the stories surrounding its sinking.
The rescue effort by six other ships was nothing short of heroic, according to testimony. 1,306 individuals were successfully pulled off the Athenia in deteriorating seas. Most of those who died were in two lifeboats that were smashed just as they were about to be saved.
""It was a shocking event,"" said Riverside curator Emily Malcolm. ""We've got several items on display including the watch from the ship's cook. We've also got a detailed model of the Athenia. You can see all the lifeboats. It was something Donaldson had made when the ship was built,"" she told BBC News.
Fritz Julius Lemp commanded submarines for another two years. He eventually lost his life in a confrontation in 1941 when his U-110 boat was forced to the surface after being damaged by depth charges. The British captured the submarine and took possession of its Enigma cipher machine.
Senior figures in the German navy were convicted at Nuremberg for war crimes in relation to the Athenia affair. The attack on an unarmed passenger liner was a clear breach of international protocols.
The five other wrecks David Mearns would like to investigate

Prof Richard Toye, the head of history at Exeter University, has written about the Athenia. The reaction to the loss had echoes in the debates we have today about the reporting of news events, he told BBC News.
""The sinking of the SS Athenia, a civilian liner, was significant not only as the first British shipping loss of the war but as an example of a Nazi attempt to promote 'fake news'.
""Fearing the impact of the affair on American opinion, the Germans promoted an absurd conspiracy theory, claiming that Winston Churchill, as First Lord of the Admiralty, had been responsible. Goebbels has a reputation as a skilful propagandist but on this occasion he was ineffective, at least as far as international opinion was concerned.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, whose new conservative party is challenging Japan’s ruling bloc in an Oct. 22 election, said on Friday there was no need for a major change in the Bank of Japan’s hyper-easy monetary policy and there should not be any sudden change under the next central bank chief.
In an interview, Koike told Reuters the BOJ had adopted a hyper-easy monetary policy, adding: “Unfortunately, this has not cured deflation. But I think there is no need for a big change in direction.”
Asked about desirable policy under the next BOJ governor, she said, “There will probably be parts that are an extension of current policy. If there were a sudden change, I think that would have an impact on the stock market.”
BOJ Governor Haruhiko has been the main architect of monetary policy under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and his 5-year term expires in early April 2018.",1

",McIlroy plots ambitious haul after injury-marred 2017,"FILE PHOTO: Golf - . Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland in action during the third round of the European Tour, Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, Kingsbarns, Britain, October 7, 2017. Reuters/Craig Brough
(Reuters) - Rory McIlroy has set his sights on becoming the best non-American golfer of all time and plans to return stronger than ever after completing an injury-marred season that has seen the Briton drop to sixth in the world rankings.
After winning the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup last year, McIlroy’s campaign was stalled by two separate injury layoffs and he signed off for the season in a tie for 63rd at the European Tour’s Alfred Dunhill Links Championship on Sunday.
The 28-year-old four-time major champion, who will now take a three-month winter break, said his first target would be to complete the career grand slam, which can be achieved next April at the U.S. Masters.
“And then, try and become the best European golfer ever. Try and surpass (Briton) Nick Faldo (who won six majors) in that,” he told British media.
“If I had a career goal, it would be to be the best international golfer ever. Gary Player has nine majors. I’d like to think I‘m going to give myself a chance to get close to that tally,” added the former world number one.
McIlroy will look to use his time off the course to fully recover from rib and back injuries that plagued him all season.
“My last round of 2017 sort of summed up all of 2017. Not much happening, good or bad. Just sort of stuck in neutral,” he said after signing for a level-par 72 at St Andrews.
”It hasn’t been the year I wanted on the golf course. I started with grand ambitions of trying to add to my major tally and trying to win golf tournaments.
“I haven’t won and the results haven’t been what I wanted, but I feel like I can still salvage something from the rest of this year, even though I‘m not playing. I’ve given myself an opportunity to put a lot of good foundations in place.”
McIlroy last went winless in 2008, a year after he turned professional as an 18-year-old. However, he said he was a better player now than he was in 2011 and 2012, when he won majors.
“I feel like I can do better than that in the next 10 years. That’s why I feel like these next three months are very important to put some really good things in place.”
American Jack Nicklaus tops the list of major winners in golf with 18 victories, four clear of compatriot Tiger Woods.

","10 Important Stories From 09/29/17 Box Scores: Story’s Turn Around, Not Buying C. Anderson & More","10 Important Stories From 09/29/17 Box Scores: Story’s Turn Around, Not Buying C. Anderson & More
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
One start means nothing in the scheme of things, but it was nice to see Masahiro Tanaka finish with a bang tossing 7.0 shutout innings allowing 3 H and 0 BB while striking out 15. It was another ace performance from Stephen Strasburg, who tossed 7.2 shutout innings allowing 2 H and 2 BB, striking out 8, to finish the year at 15-4 with a 2.52 ERA. Mike Trout posted a big day, going 2-3 with 2 HR, 2 RBI and 2 R. What else happened on the field that we need to know about? Let’s take a look…
1) Greg Bird continues to find his footing…
He went 2-2 with 2 RBI. Extending his hitting streak to 7 games. Over the streak he’s gone 10-24 with 4 HR, 11 RBI and 6 R. Even more impressive is his 4 K vs. 2 BB over the stretch, and while the end game numbers stink he’s finally showing what he can do when he’s healthy and finding his footing. Strikeouts are going to be key (he entered the day with a career 28.0% strikeout rate) and he’ll likely be more of a platoon player, but he has the potential to hit .280+ with 30 HR when things are right. He’s certainly not a player to ignore, and this late season surge is showing us why.
2) Is it time to ignore Gerrit Cole’s “upside”…
He was unimpressive in his final start, allowing 3 ER on 8 H and 1 BB, striking out 7, over 5.1 IP and finished with an average line of 12-12 with a 4.26 ERA and 1.25 WHIP. The big issue is obviously home runs (31 HR over 203.0 IP), but we obviously can’t ignore the skillset that he does bring to the table as he entered the day with an 8.61 K/9, 2.46 BB/9 and 45.8% groundball rate. Prior to ’17 he had never posted a HR/FB greater than 9.4% (he was under 7% each of the past two seasons), but entered the day with a 16.1% mark (he did avoid allowing a home run yesterday). If he can get that number back in check he’s going to be a Top 25 starter, so don’t ignore him as a post-hype sleeper heading into ’18.
3) Matt Harvey goes out with a whisper…
To call Harvey’s 2017 campaign anything more than a significant disappointment would be a mistake, as he finished up with a 6.70 ERA and 1.69 WHIP over 92.2 IP. Taking on the Phillies yesterday he allowed 4 ER on 7 H and 3 BB, striking out 3, over 4.0 IP as he’s struggled mightily with both home runs (21) and walks (67) over his 92.2 IP. We can dig into any numbers we want, but they are irrelevant. The question comes down to the injuries and whether or not he can get back to the pitcher he once was, and that’s a complete mystery. At this point he’s nothing more than a late round flier.
4) Alex Bregman continues to show his value…
He provided all of the offense for the Astros yesterday, going 3-4 with 1 HR, 3 RBI and 1 R, and after looking like a significant disappointment early on has completely turned his season around. He’s currently on a seven-game hitting streak and after hitting .256 with 8 HR and 8 SB in the first half, he’s now hitting .322 with 11 HR, 44 RBI, 48 R and 9 SB in the second half. The big differences is that he’s reduced his strikeout rate (17.0% to 13.6% entering the day) and had better luck (.291 BABIP to .333), with both numbers being highly realistic. His second half numbers are for real and he easily could replicate them over an entire season.
5) Trevor Bauer makes a big lead stand up…
The Indians jumped on the White Sox early, racking up 10 R, so it was an easy day for Trevor Bauer who took it and shutdown Chicago allowing 1 R on 4 H and 0 BB, striking out 7, over 6.0 IP. He’s pitched well overall in the second half, including allowing 2 ER or less in seven of his final nine starts. Of course he still entered the day with a 1.31 WHIP in the second half, as he carried an elevated BABIP (.338) and benefited from an unsustainable 87.1% strand rate. With a 22.5% line drive rate and 15.1% HR/FB (he allowed another home run yesterday) it’s easy to call the second half more of a mirage and, like his 17 wins, not a reason to buy in.
6) A strong finish for Ozzie Albies…
He filled the box score last night, going 3-5 with 1 HR, 1 RBI, 2 R and 1 SB. Obviously a four-game hitting streak doesn’t mean much in the scheme of things, but it definitely shows his potential as he’s gone 9-18 with 1 HR, 3 RBI, 2 R and 4 SB (he has 5 SB over his past five games). He’s now hitting .288 in the Majors, though we’d like to see a bit of an improvement in his plate discipline (10.6% SwStr%, 33.5% O-Swing% entering the day) but that should come with experience. He’s maturing in his power and has the speed, meaning he could take a significant step forward come 2018.
7) Trevor Story bringing back memories of ’16…
It’s been a disappointing season overall for Story, though he’s finishing strong. Moved to the cleanup spot yesterday he went 3-4 with 1 HR, 2 RBI and 2 R and now has 2 HR, 9 RBI and 5 R over his final three games. He’s still hitting just .239 on the season, though he does have 24 HR and 7 SB. We all know that the problem is his ability to make consistent contact, entering the day with a 34.5% strikeout rate and 14.2% SwStr%. He’s going to provide some power and speed (he could easily be a 30/10 player), but unless he cuts down on the strikeouts the average is going to be a liability.
8) Is Whit Merrifield for real…
He went 2-4 with 1 HR, 1 RBI and 1 R yesterday, putting him at .289 with 19 HR, 78 RBI, 80 R and 33 SB on the season. If you want to be picky you will point towards his .326 OBP as a reason to knock him, and that’s definitely a fair point for a player hitting atop the batting order. He could stand to improve upon his 4.7% walk rate, but he does make consistent contact (7.8% SwStr%), hits the ball hard (22.0% line drive rate) and has the speed to further improve upon his BABIP (.310). The question is going to be if he can maintain a 20 HR type pace, but there’s little question that he’s a .280+ hitter with the ability to go 15/25 once again. Throw in the fact that there’s really no reason to believe that he can’t maintain this year’s explosion and he’s going to be hard to knock.
9) Chase Anderson finishes with a strong showing…
Taking on the Cardinals he allowed 1 ER on 3 H and 1 BB, striking out 5, over 7.0 IP to finish the season at 12-4 with a 2.74 ERA and 1.09 WHIP over 141.1 IP. Of course, before we get too excited and consider him a Top 30 starter heading into 2018 we have to keep in mind that there was significant luck behind the production (80.6% strand rate, .265 BABIP) and also could easily regress in the number of home runs allowed (39.2% groundball rate, 0.89 HR/9 and a less than favorable home ballpark). Anderson has overpay written all over him at this point, and it will be interesting to see where he lands on ranking lists heading into 2018.
10) Another struggle for Tyler Skaggs…
Taking on the Mariners he allowed 3 ER on 6 H and 1 BB, striking out 7, over 4.2 IP as a pair of home runs were the big blows. That’s been the story for him, with 13 HR allowed over 85.0 IP, though we also can’t overlook his pedestrian 8.1% SwStr% and 29.6% O-Swing%. Always battling injuries and with limited upside he’s looking like a 4.25ish ERA pitcher and at this point that’s simply not someone we’d be looking to target.

The founders, whose average age was about 25 at the time, moved to London and the United States. Together with some of those co-workers, Mr. Kovalyov is developing a new Minsk start-up, AR Squad, which creates augmented reality content.
One of the first masks the other company developed was one resembling Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, Belarus’s president, who has ruled for more than two decades. He is prone to publicity stunts like picking potatoes at his estate or taking his teenage son, Nikolai, commonly referred to as Kolya, to sit at international meetings in a military uniform.

Mr. Lukashenko’s mask featured his trademark comb-over hair and bushy mustache, but was not considered offensive. On the contrary, Mr. Lukashenko began to believe that the tech industry could become a magic wand to help him end the country’s chronic dependency on Russia.
“Creation of an IT state is our ambitious but reachable goal,” Mr. Lukashenko said at a gathering of lawmakers and bureaucrats this summer. “This will allow us to make Belarus even more modern and prosperous and will let Belarusians look into the future with confidence.”
Mr. Lukashenko, who once called the internet “a pile of garbage,” began to utter improbable words for a former manager of a collective farm — about the need to develop artificial intelligence, driverless cars and blockchain technology, which allows multiple parties to keep shared digital records.
His government has taken several steps to encourage the tech industry’s development, like granting visa-free entry to citizens of 79 countries, including all Western states, when entering through the Minsk airport. Mr. Lukashenko also wants to lift restrictions on currency transfers to encourage venture financing for start-ups.

Belarus produces top-level technical talent, an inheritance from its Soviet past, said Arkady M. Dobkin, who immigrated to the United States in the 1990s and established a software company there.

Today, Mr. Dobkin is the chief executive of EPAM, which does programing for the world’s leading tech companies and is considered one of the fastest-growing public tech companies in the world.
EPAM’s headquarters is in Newtown, Pa., but its main development hub is in Minsk, where more than 6,000 of its technology specialists work.
“I think it was the absence of oil that made Belarus do this,” said Mr. Dobkin, 57. “Here, universities produce more highly qualified specialists than the internal market needs.”
Many locals say the government’s talk about growing as a tech hub is a comfortable distraction in a country that heavily depends on Russia for cut-rate fuel and political patronage.
Sergei Chaly, an outspoken economist and former government official, calls Belarus “a dying country with bitcoins.”
Photo
Vladimir Lipkovich, a popular blogger who made a career out of ridiculing Belarusian bureaucrats, said the only reason the tech industry had found some success in Belarus is that the government “cannot seize people’s brains.” He joked, “If they want to capture an IT company, what would they get, computers?”
Politics doesn’t seem a big concern for many in the tech crowd, even if young political activists use group chats on the call and messaging app Viber — an Israeli company whose development hub is in Minsk — to coordinate activities and plan rallies.

Mr. Lukashenko’s son is a fan of World of Tanks, a multiplayer online game developed in Belarus in which people fight in tank battles. With more than 200 million registered users across the world, it is one of the top 10 games in terms of total digital revenue.
Tanks have an important cultural meaning for Belarus and other former Soviet states, where almost every family has an ancestor who fought in one.
“He plays tanks, but this is controlled,” Mr. Lukashenko said of his son at a televised meeting with schoolteachers.
“One hour for tanks, 1.5 hours for music,” the president added, explaining how he controls his son’s time spent on the game. “Two hours for tanks — four hours for music.”
“Four hours is difficult,” Mr. Lukashenko said, “so he doesn’t play for longer than one hour.”",1

","Accused of War Crimes, Saudi Arabia Investigates Themselves and Find No Wrongdoing","By Carey Wedler
Amid international calls for an independent inquiry into Saudi war crimes in Yemen, the Kingdom has investigated itself and found it has done nothing wrong.
Countries including China, the Netherlands, and Canada have pushed forward with a U.N. Human Rights Council draft resolution to establish an independent investigation into Saudi war crimes against civilians in the small war-torn nation of Yemen.
This week, Human Rights Watch also accused the coalition of committing war crimes.
Though these allegations have been circulating and documented for years, little has been done to stop the Saudi attacks, and the Saudis and their U.S. and Arab allies have worked to undermine efforts to uncover wrongdoing.
“The minimal efforts made towards accountability over the past year are insufficient to respond to the gravity of the continuing and daily violations involved in this conflict,” U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad al Hussein said in Geneva this week.
The U.N. has documented 5,144 civilian deaths, mainly from the Saudi-led coalition.
The Saudis said they did not object to the current push for an inquiry but claimed it was bad timing. According to Abdulaziz al-Wasil, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Geneva:
We have no objection (to) the inquiry itself, we just have a discussion about the timing. Whether this is the right time to establish an international commission with the difficulties on the ground, and we knew in advance that they will face tremendous obstacles in terms of access.
In the meantime, the Saudi government has set up its own panel to investigate potential war crimes and misconduct. Reuters reported on the Saudi panel’s findings, noting it concluded that “a series of deadly air strikes largely [was] justified, citing the presence of armed militiamen at the homes, schools and clinics that were targeted.”
Reuters continued:
The Joint Incidents Assessment Team said on Tuesday it had discovered mistakes in only three of 15 incidents it reviewed, and maintained the coalition had acted in accordance with international humanitarian law. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has long been running the coalition fighting in Yemen as the country’s defense minister, a title he still retains.
The panel’s legal advisor, Mansour Ahmed al-Mansour, told journalists this week that, in one example, the Saudi coalition struck a water welling drill after mistaking it for a ballistic missile launcher.
However, the Saudis have been criticized for their longstanding pattern of targeting critical infrastructures such as agriculture, warehouses, and hospitals – in far more than just fifteen incidents. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) claimed in early 2016 that the Saudis had attacked hospitals in more than 100 incidents, ultimately scaring Yemenis away from seeking medical help. The coalition has also been implicated in the cholera epidemic that has infected over half a million people since April.
The United States and the United Kingdom are complicit in this targeting of Yemen, which the Saudis view as a proxy war against Iran as they attempt to reinstate a former ruler who was ousted by Houthi rebels, a group they are now fighting. There is minimal evidence that Iran is backing the Houthis.
In addition to arming the Saudis with billions of dollars worth of weapons, which are being used to commit the alleged war crimes in Yemen, the Western nations have military officials in the Saudi command room in control of air strikes.
British officials even schemed with the Saudis to paradoxically secure the repressive regime a spot on the U.N.’s human rights council. The U.S. remains a staunch Saudi backer at the U.N., as well, expressing opposition to the independent inquiry introduced this week.
Like Saudi Arabia, the U.S. has brushed off civilian casualties at the hands of their military. In accusing the Saudis of war crimes this week, Human Rights Watch also called on U.S. lawmakers to curb the killing. They wrote:
So far, the US government has been content to keep the weapons to Riyadh flowing so long as Saudi Arabia pretends it’s been fighting a clean war. But its empty promises have proved devastating – and deadly – for Yemeni civilians.
Congress should make clear the US is no longer willing to be complicit in Saudi war crimes.

The U.S. controversy over football players who kneel during the national anthem is raging on.
But an older patriotic ritual ran aground on geopolitical tensions.
That’s the Pledge of Allegiance, which was first recited in public schools on this day in 1892.
The pledge was written by Francis Bellamy, a Baptist minister and socialist, to be rolled out with a nationwide push to celebrate Columbus Day in schools. It was soon widely recognized.
Mr. Bellamy instructed that a salute be performed with the pledge: right arm extended upward, with the palm twisting up at the first mention of the flag.
When fascist regimes emerged in Italy and Germany using the extended-arm salute, Bellamy’s began to fall from favor. As one author wrote, the “similarities in the salute had begun to attract comment as early as the mid-1930s.”

On Dec. 22, 1942, Congress amended the U.S. Flag Code to instruct that the pledge “be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart” — the stance still in use today.

","Nationals Stage a Late Comeback, Perhaps Exorcising Postseason Demons","“He’s got a clutch gene,” the Nationals starting pitcher, Gio Gonzalez, said. “He’s unreal.”
Harper took advantage of a fluttering curveball left over the plate by reliever Carl Edwards Jr.
Cubs Manager Joe Maddon had the left-handed Mike Montgomery warming up and closer Wade Davis at his disposal, but he stuck with the right-handed Edwards against Harper, a lefty hitter. Maddon trusted Edwards because left-handed batters hit only .119 against him this season.
“If that happens again, you’re going to see C. J. back out there,” Maddon said, using Edwards’s nickname. “He made a bad pitch and the guy didn’t miss it, and that’s it. Sometimes that happens.”
But the move backfired against Harper, who has played only seven games over the past eight weeks because of a knee injury.
“I saw the loop in the curveball and said, ‘Why not swing as hard as you can?’” Harper said.
After Edwards walked Anthony Rendon, Maddon inserted Montgomery to face the left-handed Daniel Murphy, who bested him for a single. Then Montgomery fired a changeup over the plate to Zimmerman, who did not miss.

As Zimmerman’s towering fly ball floated toward left field and the Cubs’ Ben Zobrist drifted back, the crowd at Nationals Park rose. What had once appeared like another Cubs victory behind their postseason stalwart, pitcher Jon Lester, had become a Washington win in only a handful of at-bats.
Despite six straight winning seasons, including four N.L. East titles, the Nationals have not advanced past the first round of the playoffs. They lost to the Cardinals in 2012, the Giants in 2014 and the Dodgers last year.

“You can learn a lot from your past, but for me, the past is the past,” Zimmerman said. “This team has nothing to do with the teams in the past. Completely different feel, completely different season.”

The Nationals were shut out in Game 1 of this series on Friday, and Lester fired six stout innings on Saturday, allowing only one run, a solo homer by Rendon. Before the five-run outburst in the eighth inning, the Nationals had only four hits over the first 16 innings of the series.
“I was kind of bewildered because it’s not too many teams or pitchers that have held us in check like that for a couple days,” Nationals Manager Dusty Baker said. “I just knew in the bottom of my heart that we were going to explode.”
On Saturday, the Cubs built a 3-1 cushion before the fifth inning, thanks to home runs off Gonzalez by Willson Contreras and Anthony Rizzo.
Rizzo’s blast was unusual because he hit a Gonzalez curveball, a difficult pitch to drive over a fence, and because he became only the second left-handed hitter this year — along with Freddie Freeman of the Atlanta Braves — to hit a homer off Gonzalez.
A Cubs fan reached over the railing in right field to grab Rizzo’s shot, but the umpires upheld the home run after a replay review.
Lester, a three-time World Series winner, kept the Nationals’ powerful lineup at bay with his typical postseason savvy. He did so even when the Nationals threatened in the fifth inning with a single by Zimmerman and walks by Michael A. Taylor and Howie Kendrick. In what seemed like the game’s biggest moment to that point, Lester struck out Trea Turner to end the inning with the bases loaded.
Then in the decisive eighth, the sluggish Nationals offense finally awoke. Zimmerman, who has been a National since 2005, when the franchise moved from Montreal to Washington, hit 36 home runs in the regular season, a career high. But none of them could match the significance of his blast off Montgomery.
“I couldn’t tell you anything about that run around the bases,” Zimmerman said.
For Game 3 in Chicago on Monday, Max Scherzer is to start for the Nationals and Jose Quintana for the Cubs.",1

",India rape: Child's baby 'was fathered by second uncle',"Image copyright NOAH SEELAM/AFP/Getty Images Image caption Campaigners say 50% of abusers are known to the child or are ""persons in trust and care-givers""
A 10-year-old Indian rape victim, who gave birth to a baby girl in August, had been made pregnant by one of her uncles, police say.
Police are filing charges against the suspect - who is the second uncle of the girl's to be accused of raping her.
The first uncle has already been held and charged with raping the girl.
But police began looking for a second suspect after forensic tests revealed that the baby's DNA samples did not match those of the first accused.
Chandigarh senior superintendent of police Neelambari Vijay told the BBC that police were now rushing to also file charges against the second uncle - who is the younger brother of the first uncle.
""It's true the Baby's DNA sample has matched that of the [second] uncle,"" she said.
The next hearing in the case will be held at a local court later on Tuesday.
The first uncle will remain in custody as he is believed to have also abused the child.
The harrowing case of the 10-year-old has made headlines for weeks, both in India and globally, says the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi.
Her pregnancy was discovered in mid-July when she complained of a stomach ache and her parents took her to hospital.
A local court in Chandigarh turned down the abortion plea on the grounds that she was too far into her pregnancy after a doctors' panel advised that termination of the pregnancy would be ""too risky"". Later, the Supreme Court also refused to allow an abortion for her on similar grounds.
Indian law does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless doctors certify that the mother's life is in danger.
The girl was not aware of her pregnancy, and was told her bulge was because she had a stone in her stomach, our correspondent adds. She gave birth in August and the baby was given away to child welfare authorities for adoption.
The girl initially told police and child welfare activists that she had been raped several times in the past seven months by the first uncle to be placed under arrest, who is in his 40s.
She had also testified to the court by video link and very clearly named the uncle and revealed facts about her abuse.
The girl's father had told the BBC that the first uncle had not denied the charges against him. Police also said he had admitted to the allegations.
But after his DNA test results did not link him to the baby, police began searching for more suspects - and arrested a second uncle of the girl's in September.
Image copyright AFP Image caption India is home to 400 million children
The country's courts have received several petitions in recent months, many from child rape survivors, seeking permission to abort.
In most cases, these pregnancies are discovered late because the children themselves are not aware of their condition.
Earlier this month, a 13-year-old girl was given court permission to terminate her pregnancy at 32 weeks. The boy she was carrying was born alive in Mumbai but died two days later.
In May, a similar case was reported from the northern state of Haryana where a 10-year-old, allegedly raped by her stepfather, was allowed to abort. She was about 20 weeks pregnant, doctors said.
None of the girls can be named for legal reasons.
The scale of abuse in India
A child under 16 is raped every 155 minutes, a child under 10 every 13 hours
More than 10,000 children were raped in 2015
240 million women living in India were married before they turned 18
53.22% of children who participated in a government study reported some form of sexual abuse
50% of abusers are known to the child or are ""persons in trust and care-givers""

","As Sanctions on North Korea Ramp Up, War on Cryptocurrencies Heats Up","[gard align='center']
By Stefan Gleason
The dangerous provocations between North Korea and the United States haven’t yet escalated enough to rattle financial markets. The U.S. stock market notched another new record high last week, helping to blunt safe-haven demand for gold and silver.
The North Korea situation is, however, causing political reverberations in the crytpocurrency markets. Following China’s recent crackdown on crytpocurrency exchanges, U.S. officials may be gearing up for a regulatory attack on Bitcoin as part of an economic sanctions package.
Enter Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey (D). In an interview on CNN last Friday, Markey said, “The only answer is to go to final sanctions on the North Koreans… The cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which they are using to supply funding to their economy – all of it should be shut off.”
It’s hard to believe the regime needs bitcoins in order to keep its nuclear weapons program up and running. But U.S. politicians have lots of other reasons to launch a crackdown on the cryptocurrency. Chief among them are bringing home tax revenue and defending the U.S. dollar and banking system from free-market competition.
As with the National Security agency’s backdoors into encrypted smartphones, we may not know the U.S. government’s full technical capacity to track or disable cryptocurrency transactions until it is actually deployed (or leaked).
The U.S. possesses sophisticated cyber warfare capabilities. It is widely believed that teams of U.S. and Israeli hackers sabotaged Iran’s fledgling nuclear program through cyber attacks. It is likely that government agencies possess some sort of cyber “nuclear” weapon with which to sabotage cryptocurrency markets.
That advantage of “low-tech” free-market currencies such as gold and silver coins is that they can remain completely off the grid. They aren’t vulnerable to cyber attacks or electro-magnetic pulses.
Precious metals could be subject to conventional regulatory attacks, to be sure. The U.S. has a sad history of banning the private ownership of gold.
But in the era of digital currencies, online banking, and smartphone-enabled day trading, physical gold coins aren’t even a drop in the bucket. They’re more like a drop in the ocean relative to the tens of trillions of dollars in wealth that could be seized digitally.
It’s not the 1930s anymore. Today’s cyber economy offers previously unfathomable financial opportunities…as well as risks.
It’s not a question of whether or not to participate in the digital economy. Almost all of us do to some extent (including whenever we use debit or credit cards). The question is whether or not or to be 100% reliant on digital finances without any grounding in tangible wealth.
We don’t foresee a day when that will become safe or prudent. As long as we live in uncertain times, the timeless value of physical gold and silver should command a place in your personal finances.

",The Durham Bulls in 2017 - Part 2 - The Pitchers,"The Durham Bulls in 2017 — Part 2 — The Pitchers
(Before It's News)
42 different ballplayers pitched for the Durham Bulls this year, up from 34 in 2016, and that was in the regular season. Add a couple more for the postseason run.
Of those 42, 3 were position players thrown to the wolves at the end of losing contests: catcher Michael McKenry (3 times for 2 innings and an ERA of 58.50), outfielder Johnny Field (1⅓ innings, ERA: 20.25), and infielder Kean Wong (⅓ inning, ERA: 0.00).
13 of those 42 had less than 10 innings and were a mixture of rehabbing TB pitchers (e.g., Brad Boxberger) and short-term promotions from AA Montgomery.
Here are a few charts to get us started, beginning with the number of innings pitched.
click on chart for larger image
Then here’s a look at the ERAs (Earned Run Averages) and FIPs (Fielding Independent Percentages).
Walks and Hits per Inning Pitched (WHIP)
And, lastly, a home-grown measure of “efficiency”: Pitches per Out.
Note: we had a discussion like this last year and players mention then are marked with a ## that links to that blog post. For a complete roster check this link. List below is sorted by innings pitched. Players on 40-man marked with an asterisk *. Inside the perens: handedness, appearances, innings, won-loss, holds (h), blown saves (bs), saves (s).
Ryan Yarbrough (left-handed, 26 appearances, 157.1 innings, 13-6) was the obvious star of the Durham Bulls starters: The most wins, the most starts, most innings, 3rd best ERA (after Chirinos and Snell). He had three starts in the post-season and the Bulls won all three games (although he only got credit for one win). He came to the Rays system out of the Seattle system. At just 25, he should have a big future with the Rays. He’s not on the 40-man and has no major league time, so the Bulls might see him back next year. Stats.
Yonny Chirinos (R, 23, 141, 12-5) came up from Montgomery in early May and never looked back. At 23 years old he should also have a huge future with the Rays (and the Bulls). In 23 games he had the best ERA of the regular starting crew (see Blake Snell for the exception), the 2nd best “efficiency” rating, and the best WHIP among the starters (a superb 0.98). Plus, as with Yarbrough, he’s not on the 40-man. So we could see him again next year. In the post-season he had a win in 2 starts and only gave up one run in 10 innings. Lastly, great fun to watch. Stats.
Brent Honeywell (R, 24, 123.2, 12-8) came up from Montgomery in mid-April, so essentially spent all 2017 with the Bulls. In his 24 starts his ERA was just slightly worse (3.64) than Yarbrough — certainly more than respectable. He’s also young, just 24. His WHIP of 1.30 is above the team average. And he works pretty hard for his outs (5.56 P/O). However, in the case of a named “prospect” you’re never sure if they start each game with an instruction to “work” on something, which in turn skews their stats a bit. Stats.
*Andrew Kittredge (R, 41, 68.1, 5-1, 8h, 2bs, 2s) put in a bunch of innings as a reliever in a bunch of games. In fact, he and Adam Kolarek were tied for 2nd place in that category. He carried a stunning ERA of just 1.45, a WHIP of .095, and was extremely efficient at 4.89 pitches per out. He has had 13 innings with the Rays this year (so far — he was called up for the third time in early September). He was a key figure in the superb Bulls bullpen. By the way, he started 2 games as part of the Bulls several “bullpen days”. Stats.
Jeff Ames (R, 46, 63.1, 1-1, 4h, 2s) has numbers that, in my view, understate his importance to the Bulls this year. His ERA of 3.98 wasn’t stellar, nor was his WHIP of 1.405. And he certainly wasn’t very “efficient” at 6.03 pitches per out. On the other hand, he was always there, ready to put in an inning or two at just about any point in a game. He appeared in five post-season games and did not allow a run (and stranded 4 inherited baserunners). I’m not sure the Bulls would have made it to or through the championships without him. Stats.
*Chih-Wei Hu (R, 31, 60.2, 4-1, 4h, 1s) was yet another solid member of the relief team. He began the year as the Bulls’ #2 starting pitcher (Jacob Faria was #1), but in mid-April, the Rays called him up and decided that he was to be a relief pitcher. And that was his role both at Tampa Bay and with the Bulls for the rest of the year. He endured a lot of back and forth. By my count, he was back and forth four times during the Bulls’ season and he went back up after the Bulls finished their postseason. Very good overall performance: ERA: 3.06, WHIP: 1.15, P/O: 5.31. At a guess, he may firm up his role with the Rays this month and into the spring. He made three appearances in the postseason. The Bulls won two of those three games. Stats. ##
*Jake Faria (R, 11, 58.2, 6-1). Jake Faria (started the season as “Jacob”) was the opening day starting pitcher for the Durham Bulls and went on to do a terrific job all of April and May. He was called up by Tampa Bay and went into their rotation until going on the disabled list in August. He was back as a reliever in mid-September. Unlikely to be back as a Durham Bull. Good luck. Stats. ##
*Hunter Wood (R, 19, 53.1, 2-1, 5h) did not join the Bulls until mid-June, coming up from Montgomery. He initially went into the starting rotation and did just fine. In late July, however, he was moved to the bullpen for 13 more appearances. Overall, the young (23 years old) seems to need more work. But he sure made a difference in his three short postseason stints (two wins). I’ve heard he has a high upside in the organization, and that makes sense. His ERA (4.39), FIP (4.57), and WHIP (1.39) are not particularly impressive, but it’s a small sample size. He took an interesting path to the Bulls. He started the year in Montgomery, went up to Tampa Bay for his major league debut at the end of May. Went back to Montgomery for 3 games. Then came to the Bulls. Next year? Probably. Stats.
*Ryne Stanek (R, 36, 44.2, 3-0, 4h, 8s) is an exciting ballplayer to watch, when he’s in town. In addition to his 36 appearances with the Bulls, he made 19 with the Rays and was with them at the end of the season. Stanek has been groomed as a closer with his 100 mph fastball. A fellow Razorback (even though there’s a 50-year difference in our attendance dates), he is eventually going to stick with the Rays (or another club). As a Bull his numbers were exceptional. ERA (1.21), FIP (1.59), and WHIP (0.90) the best on the team among those with any significant amount of innings. Stats. ##
Michael Roth (L, 10, 44.1, 2-4, 1h) came to the Bulls out of the Giants system and Sacremento in the Pacific Coast League. He did not have an auspicious beginning, losing his first three starts. Things were looking better in the next two, but after that, not much. To cap it off, he left the August 24th game with what was reported to be a broken finger and has not been heard from since. Pretty dismal stats: ERA: 5.08, FIP: 5.48, WHIP 1.38. At 27 this might have been his last chance, but then there were those two really good games, and he’s left-handed. Stats.
*Blake Snell (L, 7, 44, 5-0) came back to Durham for a 7-game visit in May and June, did a terrific job, and went back to the Rays, where he has mostly struggled. Whatever is a problem for him when he wears a Rays uniform doesn’t show up when he’s in Bulls gear. He won 5 games (and the Bulls won in another start). His Game Score stat was above average in all but one of his starts. Solid ERA of 2.66. Slightly weak (for a major leaguer) WHIP of 1.32. And he did give up 5 home runs. Nevertheless, he helped the Bulls a lot in a championship season. Stats. ##
Neil Wagner (R, 32, 44, 0-1, 4h, 1bs, 3s) was doing a fine job for the Bulls this year up to the All-Star break. After that, it’s hard to say what happened. At a guess, at 33 and the oldest pitcher on the team, he became the odd man out even though he seemed to have made a solid comeback from his surgery. He was subject to a bit of back and forth with Hudson Valley getting in just a partial inning on July 26 before his release. He was immediately signed by the Mets and assigned to their Las Vegas AAA franchise. As a Bull, he was an asset with decent stats over his 44 innings (ERA-3.07, WHIP-1.16. As a Las Vegas 51er, he was superb: 8 games, 10 innings, ERA of 0.00, WHIP of 0.77. So looks like he landed on his feet. Stats. ##
Adam Kolarek (L, 41, 43.2, 3-4, 11h, 4bs, 3s) is a puzzle to me. He came out of the Mets system and was the rare lefty in last year’s bullpen. He got his call-up to the Rays in late June, stayed for July, spent August with the Bulls, and made a brief visit back with the Rays in September. As a Bull, he was a real asset. His odd semi-sidearm delivery seemed to be hard to handle (no home runs). He came into the game in difficult situations. He inherited 17 runners, the most of any Bulls reliever. Only six of those runners scored. Terrific ERA (1.65). Decent WHIP (1.15). After his return from Tampa Bay, it sure seemed like they were looking at him to be a LOOGY (Left-handed One Out GuY) and that seemed to be his role in the playoffs where he had 4 appearances and did a fine job. He was not on the 40-man at the end of the year, so hard to tell the future of this 28 year-old. Stats. ##
Diego Castillo (R, 30, 42.2, 3-2, 5h, 1bs, 7s) made a tremendous difference from the day he arrived up from Montgomery the beginning of June. Even after his numbers got hammered after a disastrous game on the 6th of July (6 runs without an out that blew up his ERA to 5.29), he stayed the course and ended the year with a decent ERA of 3.38, an even better FIP of 2.22, a WHIP of 1.15, and a very efficient P/O of 4.98. The best parts of his performance were the 7 saves, 6 of them coming after the all-star break. And then there was his work in the playoffs — 5 appearances and 3 saves — just brilliant. Plus there’s a good chance the 23 year-old will be back with Durham next year. Stats.
*Ryan Garton (R, 24, 33, 2-0, 3h, 4s) grew up in the Rays system and did a decent job this year, but got traded off to the Seattle Mariners. He was up and back to the Rays a couple of times and spent some time on the DL. But his numbers as a Bull were superb, an ERA of 1.64 and a WHIP of 0.94. He was part of a trade that included catcher Mike Marjama, yet another example of the Rays being unable/unwilling to develop young catchers. In return, the Rays got a pitcher, Anthony Misiewicz and an infielder Luis Rengifo. Misiewicz had 5 starts in Montgomery, Rengifo played in 23 games for the Bowling Green Hot Rods. Garton has had 10 appearances with the Mariners. Marjama had a short call-up to the Mariners and played 21 games with their AAA franchise in Tacoma. Stats. ##
*Austin Pruitt (R, 9, 24.2, 0-0, 2h, 1s) put in two rehab-ish stints with the Bulls and was helpful while here. Nice to see Pruitt in the majors. Stats. ##
Yoel Espinal (R, 12, 22.2, 2-1, 1h) had a very odd year. He started with the Charlotte Stone Crabs, jumped to Durham, then to Montgomery, then back to Durham and back to Montgomery, then down to the Gulf Coast Rays, and finally back where he started with the Stone Crabs (A+). At a guess, some potential. Stats.
*Chaz Roe (R, 17, 22, 0-4, 5h, 2bs, 4s) came over from the Atlanta system in mid-July. He did OK, but took 4 losses and had two blown saves. He was called up in September and has made 6 appearances in short relief with the Rays. Stats.
Players with limited innings:
*José Alvarado (L, 16, 18.1, 0-2, 2h, 1bs, 1s) came down from Tampa Bay near the end of the season, then went back.
came down from Tampa Bay near the end of the season, then went back. Diego Moreno (R, 11, 16.1, 0-0, 1h, 5s) started the season with the Bulls, went to Tampa Bay in May. Never came back. He first went on the 60-day disabled list, then was claimed off waivers by Cleveland and ended up with the Columbus Clippers.

Burch Smith (R, 3, 16.1, 2-1) was a late August addition to the Bulls roster and was very helpful filling in a starting role at the end of the season. Just three starts then, but two more in the post-season. Decent stats on a very small sample.

",Pharma's Puerto Rico problems could mean drug shortages: FDA chief,"U.S. Food and Drug Commissioner Scott Gottlieb attends an interview at Reuters headquarters in New York City, U.S., October 10, 2017. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday the country may start to see a small number of drug shortages within two or three weeks due to delays in restoring manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico, where 10 percent of drugs prescribed in the United States are made.
Hurricane Maria slammed into the Caribbean island on Sept. 20, knocking out electricity and causing widespread damage to homes and infrastructure. Almost three weeks later, just 16 percent of electricity service has been restored to the U.S. territory.
Drugmakers are working to get facilities fully online, but face an uncertain power supply and difficulty obtaining materials used in the manufacturing process.
“A lot of companies say they’re online, but they basically have one of five lines running at 20 percent or 80 percent or 50 percent,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told Reuters in an interview in New York. “They are not manufacturing at full capacity. They are manufacturing well short of that.”
“It’s unclear when they are going to be able to bring that up to full capacity,” he said.
Asked when U.S. hospitals and pharmacies might see shortages as a result, he said: “You might see some in the next two or three weeks if there’s going to be additional shortages coming out of this situation.”
The FDA has warned of 40 drugs made in Puerto Rico that could face shortages, including treatments for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and HIV, but has not named specific medicines.
Most major drug companies have manufacturing facilities on the island, including Merck & Co, Johnson and Johnson, Amgen Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Eli Lilly and Co, Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca and GSK

The FDA leader said he wants drugmakers to provide the public with more information about the extent of the problems they are facing. He said the plants were all relying on backup generators for electricity, some of which were not designed to operate for sustained periods of time.
“I‘m going to ask some of these companies to be a little more transparent around some of these issues,” he said, adding that improvements would likely come slowly, with potential setbacks along the way. “As time goes on, we’re going to see secondary impacts like the generators could start going down.”
Gottlieb said he was “troubleshooting for individual companies” on a daily basis and working with the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security to address issues such a fuel shortages and shipping problems that could stall operations.
Most of the companies contacted by Reuters said they are working to avoid product shortages.
Bristol-Myers said it has resumed limited operations to ship warehoused products. “As of today, no product supply impact is expected, however we continue to assess the challenging operational conditions on the island,” spokesman Ken Dominski said.
Amgen, in a statement, said it was “preparing to resume manufacturing in various plants over the next several weeks” and did not anticipate an impact on supply to patients.
Merck has one manufacturing facility on the island. “We have brought power back online via on-site generators that will allow most operations to proceed,” spokeswoman Claire Gillespie said.
Of the list of drugs being closely monitored by FDA, 14 medicines are sourced solely out of Puerto Rico, Gottlieb said.
He said the agency was working with drugmakers and would consider approving manufacturing sites in other countries, such as Mexico, Canada or Ireland, to alleviate possible shortages if companies have plants there.",1

",Joe Girardi Takes His Medicine - a Barrage of Boos in the Bronx,"“I’ve heard it before,” Girardi said. “They boo players and managers who have much more status than I do.”
Nobody knows what happens next for Girardi, of course, if the Yanks go on to lose this series. If they do, Game 2 may yet come back to haunt him, and the franchise. Other Yankee managers have bitten the dust after successful regular seasons that were followed by disappointing playoff performances. Dick Howser in 1980 and Buck Showalter in 1995 did not return after postseason setbacks.
Those impulsive goodbyes, however, were engineered by George Steinbrenner, not his more even-tempered son, Hal. Before the game, speaking with reporters who cover the team, Girardi was uncharacteristically forthcoming about his own job security.

“An organization has to do what they are comfortable with,” Girardi said. “And it may not always agree with the person being fired or however it goes, but that is Hal’s and Brian’s decision and whatever their decision is, I will live with it.”
Girardi has won 910 games over the last decade as the Yankees manager, but only one world championship. Ten years ago, these same opponents, the Indians, proved to be the undoing of a different Yankees manager. In that instance, Joe Torre failed to pull his team off the field in protest when Joba Chamberlain was befelled by a swarm of midges in Game 2 of a playoff series in Cleveland.
A distracted Chamberlain threw a critical wild pitch that tied the score and the Yankees went on to lose the game, and then the series. Torre later called that non-action on his part his greatest managerial regret, and in the aftermath of that series he failed to come to terms with George Steinbrenner on a new contract.

Meanwhile, despite the negative welcome Girardi received on Sunday not every Yankee fan was ready to throw him under the No. 4 train.
“I’m sticking with Girardi at this point,” said Marc Chalpin of Manhattan, another bleacher denizen. “He’s the second-best Yankee manager ever, after Billy Martin. He messed up on Friday, but when Mariano Rivera blew Game 7 in 2001, it didn’t negate his body of work.”
If the Yanks do survive this round, Girardi will be introduced again at Yankee Stadium before the American League Championship Series. Should he get that far, he probably won’t need to warn the wife and kids about what they are about to hear.",1
http://dailybuzzlive.com/atari-reveals-first-new-console-24-years-introducing-ataribox/,Atari Reveals First New Console in 24 Years: Introducing the Ataribox,"Atari hasn’t put together an official home console since the Jaguar launched in 1993. There have been various side-projects and plug-and-play one-offs, but now Atari is back in the game with a brand new console. Say hello to the Ataribox.
 
 
 
 
From the official update from Atari: “Our objective is to create a new product that stays true to our heritage while appealing to both old and new fans of Atari. Inspired by classic Atari design elements (such as the iconic use of wood, ribbed lines, and raised back); we are creating a smooth design, with ribs that flow seamlessly all around the body of the product, a front panel that can be either wood or glass, a front facing logo, indicator lights that glow through the material, and an array of new ports (HDMI, 4xUSB, SD). We intend to release two editions: a wood edition, and a black/red edition.”
 
It’s a pretty gorgeous box, to be sure. We really enjoy the neo-classic design; like something refurbished from the 80s to actually look presentable on a shelf next to sleek, modern designs from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo. So… What is this thing actually going to do for you? Is this made to compete with consoles from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo? Atari gave us another clue in its update.
 
 
Atari had to folllowing to say in its newsletter to fans: “As you can guess, those ports suggest modern internal specs. It also means that while we will be delivering classic gaming content, we will also be delivering current gaming content.”
 
So while this doesn’t sound like one of those plug-and-play toys you buy off of a Target shelf, it also doesn’t sound like Atari is attempting to make a current-gen competitor. This might be something in between; something where you can experience all of the best retro exclusives and ports that we associate with playing on Atari consoles. This may include games like Defender, Ms. Pac-Man, Galaxian, Solaris, and others.
 
The fact that they specifically mention “modern internal specs” and “current gaming content” is curious, though. Could we be dealing with an Android-based operating system that can play more modern mobile titles? After all, we’ve seen some killer mobile games lately that are based on some timeless classics. Games like Breakout and RollerCoaster Tycoon. We wouldn’t mind seeing those games on the Ataribox.
 
How powerful will it be?
 
 
We’re not quite sure yet. Other than the mention of modern specs and current games, Atari was incredibly ambiguous as to the Ataribox internals. They did acknowledge the tech heads, though:
 
“We know you are hungry for more details; on specs, games, features, pricing, timing etc. We’re not teasing you intentionally; we want to get this right, so we’ve opted to share things step by step as we bring Ataribox to life, and to listen closely to Atari community feedback as we do so. There are a lot of milestones, challenges and decision points in front of us in the months ahead. We’ll be giving you lots more information and status updates as we progress, and we are thrilled to have you along for the ride!”

",Eminem attacks Trump in freestyle rap at BET Hip Hop Awards,"Eminem has brutally criticised US President Donald Trump in a new video.
The rapper calls him a ""racist 94-year-old grandpa"" and slammed fans who back the president during a four-and-half minute freestyle.
""Any fan of mine who's a supporter of his, I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against,"" he raps in the film, shown during last night's BET Hip Hop Awards.
Twitter users can't wait to see whether Mr Trump will respond.
In the video for freestyle The Storm, Eminem is shown in a car park, stepping towards the camera to rap directly to viewers.
""If you can't decide who you like more and you're split on who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this,"" he says, raising a middle finger.
The 44-year-old slams Trump for focusing on NFL players who ""take a knee"", and causing drama on social media.
""This is his form of distraction, plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL, so we focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada,"" he says.
""All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm with the Packers.""
The rapper, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, also calls the president racist.
""Racism's the only thing he's Fantastic 4 cause that's how he gets his rock off, he's orange.""
And he praises former president Barack Obama.
""We better give Obama props 'cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust while the drama pops,"" he says.
American footballer Colin Kaepernick, basketball player LeBron James, Snoop Dogg and J. Cole are among those tweeting their appreciation for the freestyle.
But it didn't go down well with everyone.
This isn't the first time the Detroit rapper has criticised Mr Trump.
Last year he released the nine-minute freestyle Campaign Speech in which he calls the president a ""loose cannon"" who ""doesn't have to answer to no-one"".
Cardi B was the big winner at the BET Hip Hop Awards, taking five trophies including Single of the Year for Bodak Yellow.
Kendrick Lamar took four awards, including Album of the Year and DJ Khaled, Nicki Minaj and JAY-Z were also successful.

","Song dynasty bowl shatters world record for Chinese ceramics, fetches $37.7 million in HK sale","HONG KONG (Reuters) - A nearly 900-year-old porcelain Song dynasty bowl smashed the world auction record for Chinese ceramics on Tuesday, selling for HK$294.3 million ($37.68 million) at a Sotheby’s sale in Hong Kong.
The small, blue-green item broke the previous record, also set in a sale in Hong Kong, when a 500-year-old imperial “chicken” cup from the Ming dynasty Chenghua period sold for HK$281.2 million ($36.0 million) in 2014, Sotheby’s said.
The 13-cm (5-inch) bowl, used to wash brushes, was fired in the famed Northern Song dynasty (960-1127) kilns in Ruzhou, and was sold to an anonymous buyer after a 20-minute bidding battle.
Such “Ru guanyao” wares -- known for their intense blue-green glaze and “ice-crackle” pattern -- are extremely rare because the kiln in China’s central Henan province had a brief production run of only around two decades.
The bowl, from the Chang Foundation in Taiwan’s Hongxi Museum, is one of only four known pieces of Ru heirlooms in private hands. Since 1940, no more than six Ru vessels have ever appeared at auction, according to ceramics expert Regina Krahl.
“We’ve had in last 20 years a huge sort of influx of mainland Chinese buyers. We’re filling the room with new prices, new interest and that’s what’s really driven the price today,” said Sotheby’s Asia deputy chairman Nicolas Chow, who declined to reveal the nationality of the buyer.",1

","Linklater's war veteran comedy speaks to modern America, says star","LONDON (Reuters) - “Last Flag Flying”, a comedy-drama about Vietnam war veterans, will resonate with Trump’s America, despite, or perhaps because of, its period setting, actor Bryan Cranston said on Sunday after a screening at the London Film Festival.
Set in the United States in December 2003 – when U.S. forces in Iraq were dragging Saddam Hussein out of a “spider hole” - it is the story of three ageing former servicemen who reunite to bury the son of one of them who has been killed in action.
With President Donald Trump saying he could “totally destroy” North Korea and characterizing a dinner with military commanders as “the calm before the storm”, Cranston said “Last Flag Flying” was a timely reminder of the effect on normal Americans of ill-advised military campaigns.
“I think it has a lot of relevance today in the sense that (today) it’s not clear cut as far as the (what are the) intentions of the government or military,” Cranston, acclaimed for his lead role in the TV drama “Breaking Bad”, told Reuters.
“In World War Two, it was the ‘good war’, it was clear and present danger, we had to stop this mad man. Since then, with Vietnam and Iraq, (there are) a lot of questions ... among the troops and the citizens as to if we are doing the right thing and what is the purpose of our being there.”

REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde
“Last Flag Flying” was produced by Amazon Studios and directed and co-written by Richard Linklater, whose greatest critical acclaim has been for the naturalistic “Before Sunset” trilogy and the 2014 “Boyhood” which won a slew of Oscar nominations.
Linklater also made comedies including “School of Rock” and “Everybody Wants Some!!”, about skirt-chasing undergraduates. “Last Flag Flying” falls somewhere between the two genres.

The drama and comedy stem from the chemistry between the three leads, each played by a big Hollywood name.
Steve Carell is the awkward shy one who, we assume, was quiet and withdrawn even before the loss of his son. Cranston plays a foul-mouthed, hard-drinking bar owner who is his own best customer, and Laurence Fishburne, is a man who has found God and become an evangelical preacher, preferring to forget the sex and drugs they all indulged in back in ‘Nam.
Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson said the film’s ability to honor the footsoldiers while being critical of the wars they are sent to fight, could hit “an Academy sweet spot, satisfying both the more conservative oldsters and the younger, leftier types.”
Other critics said “Last Flag Flying” lacked the light touch of Linklater’s best work. The Guardian’s Benjamin Lee called it “a half-baked TV movie masquerading as Oscarbait, a curious misstep for the Oscar-nominated indie auteur”.

"http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/10/politics/steve-bannon-war-against-mitch-mcconnell/index.html
",Steve Bannon's war against Mitch McConnell,"Washington (CNN) The next step in Steve Bannon's scorched-earth war against Republican incumbents is an attempt to cut off money to those aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
The former chief strategist in President Donald Trump's White House spent the weekend in Connecticut meeting with top Republican donors, a source familiar with Bannon's plans said, as he recruits financial support for enough candidates to nationalize an anti-establishment message in 2018 GOP primaries.
He's held similar meetings in New York City and Washington, speaking with more than 25 major GOP donors so far, including hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, energy executive Dan Eberhart, private equity firm CEO John Childs and mega-donors Robert and Rebekah Mercer.
It was a continuation of what he's done every day since September 26, when the Bannon-backed former judge Roy Moore ousted Sen. Luther Strange in an Alabama Republican primary: Hold meetings to recruit candidates and form a donor network to back them.
Bannon's raison d'etre is to take on McConnell and nationalize Republicans behind Trump.
His thinking -- evidenced by the Senate's failure to advance Trump agenda items like health care -- is that Washington Republicans do not support Trump anyway. So 2018 could be a defining moment, shaking up the GOP and placing Trump's 2016 campaign agenda at its forefront.
What Bannon is seeking from prospective candidates, the source said, is one simple pledge: That they won't vote for McConnell as Senate majority leader.
Bannon's recruiting efforts have intensified over the last two weeks. He is now looking for candidates who can replicate Sen. Mike Lee's stunning ouster of former Sen. Robert Bennett at Utah's 2010 Republican convention next year against Sen. Orrin Hatch. And he is in contact with allies in Nebraska seeking a candidate to take on Sen. Deb Fischer.
And that's ""just a partial list,"" the source familiar with Bannon's plans said.
""Nobody's safe,"" the source said.
Already, he had spoken with Erik Prince, the Blackwater security contractor, and GOP mega-donor Foster Friess about running against Republican Sen. John Barrasso in Wyoming.
Bannon has also backed Kelli Ward's effort to oust Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. He hosted Danny Tarkanian in Washington to discuss his campaign against Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada. And he met recently with Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel about taking on Sen. Roger Wicker.
McDaniel, who said he is strongly considering running against Wicker, said Monday that he and Bannon have been in regular contact since 2014, when McDaniel came close to unseating Sen. Thad Cochran. Support from Bannon is helpful, McDaniel said, with strong Trump supporters who know Bannon was a leading figure on the President's campaign and with those who read Breitbart.com, where Bannon is a top executive.
""You factor in the big news he made in 2016,"" McDaniel said. ""You factor in his drive, his work ethic -- and people sense a winner and understand he can bring resources to bear, whether it's Breitbart or with financial resources.""
Bannon also plans to get involved in the primaries in West Virginia and Missouri, two of Republicans' top opportunities to pick off Democratic-held seats next year.
The plan, the source said, is for these Bannonites to nationalize their 2018 message with a consolidated, consistent argument across the map.
Bannon wants that message to be about ""big things"" -- that the grassroots Republican voters are in control and that they don't need the establishment's money or what he views as its corruption.
JUST WATCHED WH official warns Trump 'not done' with Corker Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH WH official warns Trump 'not done' with Corker 03:09
Avoiding another O'Donnell
Bannon, the source said, believes his insurgent slate will be different than the tea party calamity of 2010, when flawed candidates like Christine O'Donnell in Delaware and Sharron Angle in Nevada cost the party seats, or 2012, when Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana made controversial remarks that swung their races in Democrats' favor.
Instead, Bannon, the source said, is recruiting candidates who are focused on substance -- particularly immigration and trade -- and could win over a loose coalition of social conservatives, tea party activists and values voters.
The test case was Alabama, where Moore -- a controversial figure who was twice ousted as state Supreme Court chief justice, first for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument and later for refusing to recognize the US Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage -- defeated Strange, who benefited from $10 million in advertising from the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC.
In Alabama, Bannon broke with Trump, who had gone to Huntsville for a campaign rally for Strange just days before the election.
But the two are still in frequent contact. Bannon spoke to Trump in recent days, the source said, arguing that from Trump's perspective the Senate is already lost because the President understands he has little support there.
As if to underscore that view, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker -- the Senate foreign relations committee chairman who is retiring rather than running for re-election in 2018 -- accused Trump in a New York Times interview of putting the nation on a path to World War III and said Trump's presidency ""would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation.""
It was Corker who had urged Trump in a White House meeting to go to Alabama and campaign for Strange -- a decision the President came to regret -- according to a source who spoke to the President.
Bannon, meanwhile, has argued he is taking on Republicans who don't support Trump's policies.
Where's money coming from?
One source of financial support for Bannon-backed candidates is the Great America PAC, a super PAC led by former Ronald Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins.
The group plans to roll out an initial set of three endorsements of Republican candidates this week.
It isn't expected to be as aggressive in seeking to unseat Republican incumbents as Bannon has been, but the super PAC does intend to support Senate candidates who back Trump's agenda and call for the elimination of the Senate's 60-vote threshold to break the filibuster -- potentially including Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel, Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale, West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey and more.
It could also support candidates who could weaken Democratic senators seen as potential 2020 Trump opponents, including Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts.
""The reality here is, you have to tap into that Trump agenda intensity. And those are the candidates who can win in the general election,"" said Eric Beach, the Great America PAC co-chair.
Bannon, meanwhile, is focused on damaging people who might be considering 2020 in both parties -- including Mitt Romney, who could run for the Senate in Utah if Hatch retires.
The key, the source familiar with Bannon's plans said, ""is to prove the theory of the case"" -- that Republicans who are anti-Trump should be gone.",1

(Before It's News)
Tonight: Pittsburgh at Washington, round two, to begin at 7:05. AT&T SportsNet and 93.7 The Fan will air the game.
Lineup: Adam Frazier 2B, Starling Marte LF, Cutch CF, Josh Bell 1B, David Freese 3B, Gregory Polanco RF, Elias Diaz C, Sean Rodriguez SS, Cole P. Jordy’s knee must have been pretty banged up; his absence shows the bench hole at middle infield, especially with J-Hay out. Hopefully, after an offseason of rest, we’ll get the 2016 S-Rod back to fill it.

Pitchers: Gerrit Cole (12-11, 4.23) and Stephen Strasburg (14-4, 2.68) are the gunslingers. It may be a meaningless game for the standings, but it’s tough not be juiced up over a Cole v Strasberg head-to-head. Gerrit is making his career-high 33rd start of the season and should break the 200 IP mark for the second time. It’s been a roller coaster season for Cole Train. He’s dropped his last two road games and has given up 31 home runs (amazingly, he had never given up more than 11 in a season until this year), which is one shy of the club record of 32 allowed by Murry Dickson in 1951. Cole is finishing up on a winning note, going 9-5 over his last 19 starts. He’s 3-1/2.56 in five career starts against the Nats and won a 6-1 decision in May in his only 2017 outing. The Nats are giving Stephen an extra day or two between starts to preserve his arm for the money games. Strasburg is still one of the elites with 10.5 K/nine, a 1.038 WHIP, and the rest of his peripherals equally shiny. He has a win over the Bucs this year, though it wasn’t one of his better outings (six IP, three ER), when he took an 8-4 count over Chad Kuhl.
Notes:
Starling Marte extended his hitting streak to nine games with a 2-for-4 performance last night.

Bryce Harper should be available for the rest of the series after missing yesterday’s game w/hyperextended knee.
Love that dirty water: The Bucs have gone 29-49 on the road this season, having lost six in a row and 12 of their last 13. The club hasn’t won back-to-back games away from PNC Park since late August. Pittsburgh posted a 40-41 record on the road last season.
Pete Mackanin will not return as Phils manager next year; he’s being kicked upstairs to serve as a special assistant to the GM. Mac managed the Pirate farm clubs Hickory Crawdads and Lynchburg Hillcats in 2001 and 2002, then became Lloyd McClendon’s bench coach for the for the 2003 season. After Lloyd was fired, Mackanin served as the Pirates’ interim manager for the last month of 2005 and spent the next season managing at Bradenton before moving on in 2007.

",IRS Awards Multi-Million Dollar Fraud-Prevention Contract To Equifax Who Was Hacked TWICE,"[gard align='center']
By Aaron Kesel
You can’t make this up. The IRS awarded Equifax with a multi-million dollar fraud prevention no-bid contract despite that its own execs committed market fraud when they sold shares before telling the public they were hacked.
The IRS will pay Equifax $7.25 million to help verify taxpayer identities and prevent fraud under a no-bid contract issued last week.
The credit agency will “verify taxpayer identity” and “assist in ongoing identity verification and validations” at the IRS, according to the award.
The award describes the contract as a “sole source order,” which means Equifax is the only company held capable of providing the service. The order was issued to prevent a lapse in identity checks while officials resolve a dispute over a separate contract.
Both Republican and Democrat lawmakers bashed the IRS decision as irresponsible and horrible.
“In the wake of one of the most massive data breaches in a decade, it’s irresponsible for the IRS to turn over millions in taxpayer dollars to a company that has yet to offer a succinct answer on how at least 145 million Americans had personally identifiable information exposed,” Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told POLITICO in a statement.
“The Finance Committee will be looking into why Equifax was the only company to apply for and be rewarded with this. I will continue to take every measure possible to prevent taxpayer data from being compromised as this arrangement moves forward,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said.
Reps. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) and Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) also expressed their distaste for the deal writing letters to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen demanding he explains why the agency awarded the contract to Equifax as well as provide information on any alternatives they may have considered.
“I was initially under the impression that my staff was sharing a copy of the Onion, until I realized this story was, in fact, true,” Blumenauer wrote.
The IRS defended its decision in a statement, stating that Equifax told the agency that none of its data was involved in the breach and that Equifax already provides similar services to the IRS under a previous contract.
“Following an internal review and an on-site visit with Equifax, the IRS believes the service Equifax provided does not pose a risk to IRS data or systems,” the statement reads. “At this time, we have seen no indications of tax fraud related to the Equifax breach, but we will continue to closely monitor the situation.”
Early last month Equifax was hacked exposing the personal information of as many as potentially 150 million Americans, which included social security numbers, birth dates, and other private information.
Afterwards three executives sold off $1.8 million dollars of the companies stock before telling the public. The Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into those three Equifax executives.
Another fun fact: the identity verification systems the IRS uses are made by credit-rating agency Equifax. The system, known as Knowledge-Based Authentication, or KBA, asks questions based on a person’s credit history, such as “On which of the following streets have you lived?” or “What is your total scheduled monthly mortgage payment?”
If that’s not enough Quartz reports that in 2015, the Equifax KBA system was hacked in a data breach that resulted in the loss of more than 700,000 tax records.
Former Equifax CEO Richard Smith was put in front of congressional committee hearing this week and apologized for mistakes which led to the massive breach.
Smith additionally called for an end to Social Security numbers, claiming the country needed “to think beyond” the identifiers.
“What is a better way to identify consumers in our country in a very secure way? I think that way is something different than an SSN, a date of birth and a name,” he said, according to Bloomberg.
With two breaches under its belt including one involving an IRS system can any person state one valid reason to give Equifax a $7.25 million contract; and tell me how on earth the firm is still seen as “capable” to do the job?

A former Memphis police officer was recently arrested near the White House after police found a variety of weapons during a search in which the man openly claimed to work for the Central Intelligence Agency.
 
The man, Timothy J. Bates, was arrested last Sunday with an arsenal of firearms, including an assault rifle and a loaded AK-47. The weapons were found after Bates oddly allowed officers to search his car while ranting about a CIA microchip implanted in his head and the need for his paycheck which would presumably be for work he carried out for the agency (if true).
 
“According to court documents, Bates was approached by uniformed members of the Secret Service on Sunday at the corner of 17th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue as he appeared to be publicly urinating. He told the officers he was trying to reach Defense Secretary James Mattis or NSA Director Mike Rogers for advice on missing paychecks and how to get the dog chip out of my head,” The New York Post reported.
 
“Bates told the Secret Service officers that he had been offered $28.7 million by the Department of Homeland Security and the state of Tennessee to participate in the CIA’s ‘MK Ultra’ program and that he had a chip planted in his head that was causing him ‘severe headaches, shaking and convulsions,'” the report continued.
 
That’s right, a former police officer who had loaded weapons extremely close to the White House openly claimed to officers on scene that he was a member of the MK Ultra program and was looking for payment for his work.
 
 
 
 
 
It is obviously possible that this is simply a case of an extremely crazy person babbling nonsense, but when you consider both the CIA’s history of mind control as well as the ongoing deep state operation to take out the president, one can only wonder if this was someone who intelligence operatives had planned to use to take a shot at Donald Trump.
 
From literally thousands of threats to assassinate Trump coming from social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter, coupled with the fact that high-level establishment operatives have floated the idea of killing Trump, it is certainly not inconceivable that the Secret Service stopped at least part of a real plot to take out the president.
 
Predictably, the mainstream media largely ignored this absolutely huge story, instead focusing on fake news claims that the White House isn’t helping Puerto Rico as well as continued coverage of the discredited Russian narrative.
 
To them, a story such as this is simply one they do not believe you have a right to read.

",Sheriff and Deputies Indicted for Locking Down Entire School and Sexually Assaulting Kids,"By Matt Agorist
Worth County, GA — In June, violated children and furious parents filed a massive lawsuit after the Worth County Sheriff’s office conducted an illegal search of 900 students, sexually abusing multiple children in the process. Now, after nearly half a year, a grand jury has finally indicted the people responsible for this heinous deprivation of rights.
A south Georgia grand jury indicted Worth County Sheriff Jeff Hobby on Tuesday for sexual battery, false imprisonment and violation of oath of office after he ordered a school-wide search of hundreds of high school students. Deputies allegedly touched girls vaginas and breasts and groped boys in their groin area during the search at the Worth County High School April 14, reports RARE.
Two of Hobby’s deputies were also indicted this week in connection with the case.
Norman Crowe Jr., Hobby’s attorney claims the sheriff is innocent and conducted no searches.
“The sheriff’s position is that he’s not guilty,” Crowe said. “He’s committed no crime.”
As the Free Thought Project previously reported, an Atlanta attorney is now representing multiple students who were subjected to invasive and outright horrifying body searches during a mass — and warrantless — search for drugs at a South Georgia high school. Attorney Mark Begnaud, who filed the class-action lawsuit, called out the sheriff for conducting “900 illegal, suspicionless searches.”
“This was a textbook definition of overreach,” said Begnaud. “They pulled 900 students out of class. They did full, hands-on body searches.”
To highlight the sheer unnecessary police state tactics of the tyrannical Worth County Sheriff Jeff Hobby and his deputies — not a single bit of contraband was found.
As the Daily Report notes, Begnaud said the suit seeks certification as a class action on behalf of every student who was searched. It also asks for unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, as well as a declaratory judgment that a law enforcement officer violates a student’s constitutional rights when he conducts a body search absent either voluntary consent or an individualized suspicion that the student has broken the law. The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Leslie Abrams.
On April 14, when the students of Worth County High School returned from spring break, they arrived at school to find a police state had taken over. The sheriff and his deputies — with no probable cause — detained and illegally searched every single child in the school, all 900 of them. More than 40 cops from five other law enforcement agencies participated in the raid — a handful of those cops were apparently sexual predators.
When kids went home that day to tell their parents what happened, naturally, they were furious as it is a gross violation of the children’s 4th Amendment rights.
“It’s essentially a fourth amendment violation,” said Begnaud. “It’s 900 illegal searches, suspicion-less pat downs, suspicion-less searches.”
Naturally, Sheriff Jeff Hobby is standing by this rights violation on a massive scale, noting that as long as a school administrator was present, the search of the children was legal.
Apparently, in the sheriff’s mind, school administrators can usurp the constitutional rights of children in favor of unlawful police searches.
But school officials and the student rule book disagree.
In the student handbook, it says school officials may search a student only if there is reasonable suspicion the student has an illegal item.
As WALB reported at that time, Worth County Schools attorney Tommy Coleman said in order for the Sheriff’s office to search any students, they’d had to have reason to believe there was some kind of criminal activity or the student had possession of contraband or drugs.
“If you don’t have that then this search would violate an individual’s rights,” said Coleman. “[It] violates the constitutional right and enforcing them the right against unreasonable search and seizures.”
Interim Worth County Superintendent Lawrence Walters said he understands parents concerns about the drug search at Worth County High school on Friday, according to WALB.
“I’ve never been involved with anything like that ever in the past 21 years and I don’t condone it,” said Walters.
Walters said he was notified that there was be a search but pointed out that he did not give permission nor did he approve the mass groping of children.
“We did not give permission but they didn’t ask for permission, he just said, the sheriff, that he was going to do it after spring break,” said Walters.
“Under no circumstances did we approve touching any students,” explained Walters.
Many of the charges faced by the sheriff and his deputies stem from the fact that several students complained that they got far more than just a pat down.
According to the complaint,
Defendants’ searches of students were intrusive, performed in an aggressive manner, and done in full view of other students. For example: a) Deputies ordered students to stand facing the wall with their hands and legs spread wide apart; b) Deputies touched and manipulated students’ breasts and genitals; c) Deputies inserted fingers inside girls’ bras, and pulled up girls’ bras, touching and partially exposing their bare breasts. d) Deputies touched girls’ underwear by placing hands inside the waistbands of their pants or reaching up their dresses; e) Deputies touched girls’ vaginal areas through their underwear; f) Deputies cupped or groped boys’ genitals and touched their buttocks through their pants. 8. Defendants had no warrant or other authority to perform a mass search on hundreds of public school children.
When multiple students complained about being groped by at least one sicko deputy, Sheriff Hobby ensured parents and school officials that “corrective action was taken to make sure the behavior will not be repeated.” However, it took six months and a grand jury to do that, no thanks to Hobby.
“I’m okay with them doing the search, if it was done appropriately like the school has done in the past,” said father of two Jonathan Luke. “But when they put their hands on my son, that’s crossing the line.”
Aside from not finding a single bit of contraband, the sheriff’s search was also entirely uncalled for as the Sylvester Police Department did a search on March 17 — just a few weeks before — and found no drugs.

",The Last Jedi trailer: Four big questions we want the answers to,"Image copyright Lucasfilm Image caption Will Daisy Ridley's Rey use the Force for good or evil?
The first full trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi does its job brilliantly - it teases galaxy-rattling plot lines while leaving you unsure about whether what you think will happen is what is actually going to happen.
On top of that, there are the ""oohs"" of spectacular battle scenes combined with the ""ahhs"" of some new cute fluffy creatures.
We also see Carrie Fisher in some of her final shots as General Leia, filmed before her death last Christmas.
Above all, it raises some big questions about what might unfold in the Star Wars universe.
These might be spoilers. They might not. We're not sure yet.

Will Rey go to the Dark Side?

""When I found you, I saw raw, untamed power. And beyond that... something truly special.""
Those are the opening, growling words from Snoke, Andy Serkis's Supreme Leader of the First Order, who we see properly for the first time.
Is he talking about Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who is in some of the opening shots? Or is he actually talking about Rey (Daisy Ridley), who the trailer then cuts to?

She's seen learning to harness the Force on Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) island retreat.
""I've seen this raw strength only once before,"" he intones, looking pretty petrified, apparently comparing Rey to Ren. ""It didn't scare me enough then. It does now.""
At the end of the trailer, we see Snoke apparently torturing Rey before she says: ""I need someone to show me my place in all this.""
It looks like she's talking to Ren. He offers his hand. Clever trailer editing? Or do they really join forces?

""That's the only way to become what you're meant to be,"" he adds.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/04/europe/catalan-president-tv-address-spain-crisis/index.html,Catalonia: Carles Puigdemont criticizes Spanish King,"(CNN) Catalonia's leader has launched a strongly worded attack on the King of Spain for failing to heal the country's divisions after a bitterly contested independence referendum.
In a TV address from the headquarters of the Catalan government in Barcelona on Wednesday, Catalan President Carles Puigdemont said King Felipe had missed an opportunity to mediate in the political and constitutional crisis that has engulfed the country.
The King delivered a stern warning in a TV address on Tuesday, saying Catalan leaders had acted ""outside the law"" and accusing them of ""unacceptable disloyalty"" for pressing ahead with their moves toward secession.. Catalonia is an autonomous region of Spain, located in the northeastern part of the country.
Puigdemont said the Spanish monarch ""ignores millions of Catalans who think in a different way"" to the central government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.
""You disappointed many people in Catalonia who appreciate you and are expecting a call to dialogue,"" Puigdemont said after the King's hard-line remarks.
The King has a constitutional duty to arbitrate when there is a diplomatic dispute, Puigdemont said.
""We need mediation,"" he said. ""This conflict needs to be resolved in a political way, not with police.""
He directed parts of his address to Spaniards in other parts of the nation, to the King and to Catalonians.
Urging calm
Puigdemont is expected to formally declare independence on Monday, after 90% of voters in last Sunday's referendum opted for a split. The vote was marred by clashes between citizens and Spanish police.
Puigdemont urged calm.
""Let's not allow other people to provoke us. Let's not fall into provocations of violence,"" he said.
Puigdemont said that while others say the vote was illegal, Catalonia will follow ""a democratic way"" that should be respected.
The Spanish government on Wednesday said it ""strongly rejects the accusations"" Puigdemont directed at the King.
""These accusations show that Mr. Puigdemont not only is against the law, but also is outside reality,"" the government said.
""Tonight he lost every opportunity to bring Catalonia back to the path of coexistence within the law. Far from that, he went one step further in his path to radicalization, isolation and defiance of institutions.""

Puigdemont's remarks came as the Catalans' standoff with Madrid deepened Wednesday. Spain's highest court summoned the chief of the Catalan police to answer accusations of sedition, or provoking a rebellion against the state.
Josep Lluís Trapero was called to testify in Madrid on Friday: Spanish authorities believe Trapero's 17,000-strong force did not do enough to prevent the banned referendum from taking place. Sedition by public officials carries a 15-year sentence in Spain.
He was ordered to appear with three others: his deputy Teresa Laplana and the leaders of pro-independence groups Catalan National Assembly and Omnium Cultural, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez.
Protesters joined by firefighters raise their hands as they gather during a general strike in Barcelona Tuesday.
Puigdemont is due to address the Catalan Parliament on Monday, in a session called to ""discuss the results of the referendum on October 1 and its effects,"" a statement from the parliament said.
It will be Puigdemont's first opportunity to make a formal declaration of independence under the Catalan referendum law that was ruled illegal by Spain's top court.
Such a move would severely test the government of Prime Minister Rajoy. If Madrid decides that Catalonia is acting unconstitutionally, Rajoy could invoke emergency powers to take control of the Catalan government.
That would almost certainly require officers from the Guardia Civil, the national security force, to be deployed again on the streets of Catalonia. Thousands are on standby in the port of Barcelona, and their redeployment would be highly provocative after they led a violent crackdown of Sunday's referendum.
Business groups rattled
The prospect of a rupture in Spain's young democracy -- the dictatorship of Francisco Franco ended only in 1975 -- has rattled business groups.
The Spanish business lobby group, Cercle d'Economia, said it was concerned by the prospect of a declaration of independence and called for both sides to start talks.
""Such a declaration would plunge the country into an extraordinarily complex situation with unknown, but very serious consequences,"" the group said in a statement reported by Reuters Wednesday.
JUST WATCHED A look inside Catalonia's referendum vote Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH A look inside Catalonia's referendum vote 02:43
The developments have also alarmed the European Union, which has so far supported Madrid.
Speaking at a debate on Catalonia in the European Parliament on Wednesday, European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans called for dialogue. ""All lines of communication must stay open. It's time to talk to find a way out of the impasse,"" he said.
Timmermans backed the Spanish government's stance: ""This is an internal matter for Spain that has to be dealt with in line with the constitutional order of Spain,"" he said.
But he lamented Sunday's events, when the Guardia Civil raided polling stations, fired rubber bullets and dragged people out of voting centers. ""Violence does not solve anything in politics,"" he said.
The referendum and its aftermath has split Catalans. Some 90% of voters backed a split from Spain, but turnout was only around 42%, largely because anti-independence Catalans did not show up.
Barcelona taxi driver Ana Maria Lopez, who opposes a split, said Puigdemont ""thinks he's a king"" and said a declaration of independence would be meaningless: ""Him declaring independence is like me declaring 'from tomorrow I'm a princess,' "" she told CNN.
But like many in Catalonia, she was critical of the central government in Madrid, saying its poor handling of the situation had made things worse.
Anti-independence groups staged a small demonstration in Barcelona on Wednesday evening.
About 200 people gathered in front of Spanish government buildings and chanted""You are not alone"" and ""This is our police"" to the officers from the Spanish National Police and Guardia Civil who guard the buildings.",1

Four time best-selling financial book author James Rickards says don’t get too comfortable with the record high stock prices. Rickards explains, “I think the markets will have a very violent reversal in late November or early December. Let me be specific about why because I never make claims like this without backing it up. . . . Here’s what’s going on. Right now, markets are priced for a Fed rate hike in December. . . . The stock market is interpreting this rate hike as economic strength . . . everything is set for a violent reversal because the Fed is not going to hike interest rates in December.”

So, why is the Fed not going to raise rates? Rickards says it’s because of not enough inflation and way too much deflation. This has the Fed scared to move. Rickards contends, “Why is deflation a central bank’s worst nightmare? The answer is deflation increases the real value of debt. In other words, the dollar actually gets stronger in a deflationary environment. If I owe you dollars, and the dollar just got stronger, I owe you more money in real terms. It becomes more difficult to pay off debt in a deflationary environment because my income is drying up. The real burden of debt is going up, and if I couldn’t pay you to begin with, deflation is going to make it more difficult to repay you. . . . Imagine if we had one or two percent deflation . . . and the value of the debt was going up. The defaults would be even worse. Bad debts would pile up. The banking system would be under threat. Tax collections would go down in nominal terms. The credit of the U.S. government would be called into question. The U.S. government might default. These are all the horrendous consequences of deflation, and it’s why central banks cannot have deflation.”
 
So, what happens if Rickards is correct and the Fed does not raise rates? Rickards says, “When that happens, and I think it will happen . . . all of a sudden, the dollar is going to get weaker, the euro is going to get stronger, gold is going to go up and bonds are going to rally. So, there will be a lot of big market effects. I am not talking the end of the world . . . . I am not talking about a total meltdown. I am talking about a violent repricing of some major commodities and bonds . . . because the market thinks the Fed is going to raise, and they’re not.”
 
Is there a danger in October as many believe there could be? Rickards says “yes,” and it comes from increased tensions with North Korea. Rickards says, “We have a window from October 10th to October 21st. What is the significance of that window? October 10th is the anniversary of the communist party of North Korea. Kim Jong Un is getting ready to test more missiles. . . . We have two catalysts. The anniversary on October 10th and war games (with South Korea) on October 21st. In that window is when I expect one or more missile tests. That’s going to be another wake up call to the markets. The markets are sleepwalking . . . they don’t understand this war is coming, and it is coming. A shooting war, a pre-emptive war, a kinetic war with the United States against North Korea, I do expect by mid-2018. . . . Kim Jong Un thinks we are bluffing. We are not.”
 
Rickards also restates his case for “$10,000 gold” and contends it’s at a relatively low price, and people should buy it now and simply hold it.

It’s finally here.
Today starts Game 1 of the ALDS and this is going to be one heck of a tough series. It feels good to FINALLY be in the postseason again, but this is an ugly “welcome back to the ALDS” match-up and the Yankees are gonna have to be on their A+ game to win this series. Here are some key things that have to happen (the most important ones) to get past the Indians.
Photo: MLB.com
1. WIN the first game
I have always liked Terry Francona because he isn’t afraid to take a risk and he is smart. Game one is important to the Yankees because Francona has opted to start Trevor Bauer INSTEAD of Corey Kluber, but don’t be fooled because that is all by design. Normally, managers start their best pitcher one Game one but not this time. Bauer is a good pitcher, but he is no Kluber. Realistically, Kluber is likely to be the AL Cy Young winner at least in my opinion. I think he gets it over Chris Sale.
Photo: MLB.com
Pitching Bauer before Kluber means Kluber could pitch games two and then five on regular rest. Kluber on regular rest is very important to the Indians. They have asked him to pitch on short rest three times last year in the postseason and they don’t want to do that again yet. The Indians ace is lined up for two games in this series. Winning Thursday in Cleveland will give the Yankees momentum, and if you like interesting tidbits like me, teams who win the first game in a best of five series statistically go on to win that series 71% of the time. It’s a nice stat…..and an even better one if Francona knows it and loses. Let’s make the Indians a little uncomfortable and if Sonny Gray pitches a great game and out offense handles Bauer we carry the momentum.

I hate to say it but the first game is basically a MUST WIN. Chad Green and David Robertson will be unavailable for game One, so that will hurt. The last thing the Yankees want to do is drop the first game and have to worry about a potential 0-2 deficit with Kluber on the mound tomorrow.

2. Battle through Kluber & DON’T give up
Game two is going to be hard! This matchup is going to be interesting with former Indians ace CC Sabathia dueling against current ace Kluber. I am intrigued already. The Yankees have a lot of experience with CC on the mound but they have not had much success against Kluber.

Looking at the Yankee lineup Jacoby Ellsbury has the most success against him at 5-for-19. The Yankees will need to try and drive up his pitch count and capitalize on any of his mistakes which seems unlikely, but so far pitchers have had a rough time in this early postseason so it’s possible. Even if the Yankees manage to get Kluber out early their bullpen is similar to the Yankees and have some great arms like former Yankee Andrew Miller. Luckily in game two Green and Robertson will be available if needed.
3. Rain is in the forecast for Friday
The current forecast has it raining ALL DAY in Cleveland. If that is the case, the game would likely be postponed until Saturday. That would mean three games in a row which could be bad for the bullpens BUT it could be a major advantage for the Yankees. The Indians want to pitch Kluber on regular five day rest as mentioned above…..if game 2 is moved to Saturday and he has to pitch in it he would be starting on short rest. Hmmmm. I like the potential hole in Francona’s masterful plan.

4. Take advantage of Yankee home games
The Yankees have very different splits with home and away games. Their away record this year was 40-41 but at home they are 52-30 if you count their Wild Card win the other night. The Yankees know how to capitalize on their short right porch and have lefty power to send balls over the wall. Not to mention there is nothing like playing in Yankee stadium in the playoffs. Ask Aaron Judge how electric the crowd was Tuesday night. The Yankees can feed off of that energy and use it to their advantage.

5. Arms & bats need to do their jobs
The bullpen is going to be a difference maker here. Both teams have a deep bullpen but there is nothing quite like the combination of Yankee relievers. The reliable Dellin Betances will need to show up and be effective and Joe Girardi will have plenty of arms to mix and match to whatever his binder tells him to do. The bats also need to do their job.
Photo: Getty Images
The Yankees will need Judge, Gary Sanchez and Didi Gregorius to set the tone and stay hot at the top of the order like the did against the Twins. The rest of the lineup will need to keep the hits going.
The Yankees are the underdog in this series, but anything can happen in the postseason. The Indians had everything go their way in the regular season and want to finish what they started last year with a ring. The Yankees surpassed everyone’s expectations and are hungry to prove everyone wrong.
Who wants it more? We are about to find out….bring it on, Indians!

",AIBA president Wu suspended by amateur body,"(Reuters) - The International Boxing Association’s (AIBA) Taiwanese president Ching-kuo Wu has been provisionally suspended by a disciplinary commission, the Olympic sport’s governing body said in a statement on Tuesday.
The Swiss-based organization has been riven with in-fighting for months, with Wu pitted against most of the executive committee who failed to remove him through a vote of no confidence tabled in July.
AIBA said on their website (www.aiba.org) that the 70-year-old was served on Monday with a provisional and immediate suspension from duties pending the conclusion of a complaint against him.
It said the complaint was made by 11 AIBA executive committee members on Oct. 1 who alleged that Wu had “violated and continues to violate various provisions of AIBA’s Statutes and Codes” and demanded his suspension.
“The Chairman of the Commission and the Commission panel assigned to this matter believe that the situation is urgent and require immediate provisional measures be ordered,” the statement added.
There was no immediate comment from Wu and AIBA officials, including executive director William Louis-Marie, who did not respond to telephone and email approaches by Reuters.
Wu, who was elected AIBA president in 2006 and is a member of the International Olympic Committee’s executive board, has rejected claims of financial mismanagement and accused opponents of “political maneuvrings” as part of a power struggle.",1

",New Coach Reminds Fans That Purdue Has a Football Team,"A former N.F.L. quarterback and Bobby Petrino acolyte, Brohm has brought renewed energy and pass-heavy schemes to a place that treasures its title as the Cradle of Quarterbacks (Len Dawson, Bob Griese, Jim Everett and Drew Brees are among the signal-callers who played at Purdue), but he also has shown — again — what a difference a new coach can make in college football.
“It definitely feels different,” Purdue linebacker Markus Bailey said. “We don’t go into games expecting to have moral victories.”
Brohm and the rest of the coaching staff, many of whom came with him from Western Kentucky, “bring it every day to practice and push us to be the best we can be,” Bailey said. “You can tell in his demeanor and his attitude that he loves football, and he makes players want to play for him.”
Bailey added, “I mean, I’ll play for that dude any day.”
The coaching carousel is a mainstay of the college football landscape, and since the sport places heavy restrictions on its unpaid players’ ability to transfer while coaching contracts routinely include seven-figure buyouts, hasty firings can make cynics of even the most idealistic fans.
But the reality is that aside from the way the players are compensated, college football is business, and in a landscape in which resources are spread out widely, particularly within conferences, and in which the position of head coach is perhaps uniquely powerful, coaching can make a titanic difference to teams’ success and programs’ bottom lines.
“He’s the general manager, he’s the on-field coach, he has a P.R./spokesperson element,” Chris Brown, a widely respected football analyst and author of “Smart Football” (as well as a Purdue alumnus), said of the head coach in college football. “If you can do all those things, that can be very, very valuable.”

Occasionally, a new head coach’s task is simply to keep up his predecessor’s winning ways — something Justin Fuente, who succeeded Frank Beamer at Virginia Tech last season, and Lincoln Riley, who was promoted from offensive coordinator to replace Bob Stoops at Oklahoma this season, have done ably so far.

More often, though, the previous coach’s departure, voluntarily or otherwise, was a result of perceived (or actual) underperformance, and the new guy’s job is to win more games than the old guy did. Such briefs were given this season both at teams that expect to compete for conference titles every year — Texas, Louisiana State, Oregon — and at teams with more modest expectations and goals, like Minnesota, California and Purdue.
Firing Hazell reportedly cost Purdue nearly $5 million, but with annual payouts for Big Ten members expected soon to top $40 million, the university can afford it. And if Brohm continues to excite fans and win games, more sellouts and donations could follow, meaning that from a green-eyeshade perspective, the “dead money” of the Hazell buyout could come to seem more like a successful investment in the program’s future.

“Our fans were thirsty,” Bobinski said, adding, “We’ve had such an immediate and apparent change in style, approach, competitiveness, intensity.”
Brohm’s signature is his inventive passing schemes, honed as a quarterback and coach for teams in college, the N.F.L., arena league football and even, in 2001, the short-lived X.F.L.
Last year, his Western Kentucky squad ranked first in the Football Bowl Subdivision at 45.5 points per game, and fifth in passing yards.
At Purdue, Brohm has created a platoon system at quarterback, with David Blough, who started the past two seasons, sharing snaps with the sophomore Elijah Sindelar. The more modest focus, Brown noted, has been on limiting turnovers. The quarterbacks’ combined four interceptions over four games is a rate exactly half of last season, when Purdue had 24 in 12 games.
Against Michigan, the most striking difference for Purdue might have been on defense, where pass-rushers compiled four sacks and forced several balls to be thrown away.
“I think the players know, lined up against Michigan, against five-star guys, at least they know their coaches are putting them in a position to succeed,” Brown said.
In his postgame remarks, Brohm was more muted, acknowledging his team had been “beaten down” in the second half and emphasizing that rebuilding Purdue’s program would be a process.

But he was effusive about one aspect of the day, an opinion surely shared by the athletic department.
“The crowd was amazing,” he said. “We’re very appreciative of all the people that showed up.”
He added, “It does make it a lot more fun when everyone feels a part of it.”",1

(Before It's News)
Dearest Baltimore,
To quote Chad Ochocinco on a daily basis, I love y’all.
I truly do.
And it’s because of that love that I’m going to ask a favor of you: whether you are entrenched in a patellar-based quarrel, or just pissed about last week’s performance, I’m gonna need you to get your collective heads out of your collective asses!!
STEELERS WEEK IS UPON US!
If even for just one weekend, I don’t want to hear the drama. Just lock it up, tweet/delete it, or save the Facebook post in your draft for the post-game.
Instead, I want you to wear your purple with pride, hit the streets on this beautiful Purple Friday, and let the random Steelers fans in town know that we don’t cower in the face of controversy, that we come together as a family, and we cannot be divided by anything, especially on this week when we plan to trounce Pittsburgh!
Let all of those feels resurface, Baltimore…
Of course, those pesky Steelers fans won’t just go away (trust me, I’ve tried). No, they’ll surely spit crap back at ya (I want to say figuratively, not literally, but ya never know with them…).
And with that, let’s go ahead and start the weekend of mockery with what can only be deemed the Top 5 Yinzer-isms. The most ear piercing, nails on the chalkboard, idiotic things that tend to dribble out of the jack-o-lantern-esque smirks of every Steelers fans anytime you try to drop a knowledge bomb on them.
Shall we?
Oh, and side note- please fell free to turn this into a drinking game come Sunday. Because if it goes anything like last Sunday? You’ll need a few (dozen)…
5.”Flacco’s a bum!”
Response: So let’s look at this objectively… Joe Flacco has faced Pittsburgh 20 times in his career, with a 10-10 record (9-8 regular season, 1-2 playoffs) against the Steelers, with wins in his last three games in Baltimore against Mike Tomlin & friends. Looking at the first head-to-head match-up in every season since Flacco came into the NFL in 2008, Joe has beat Pittsburgh seven of a possible nine times. Sure, you’ll point to the playoffs, to which I’ll simply say Flacco has only faced the Steelers three times in the playoffs, winning his most recent game 30-17 in 2014. A few years earlier he won a Super Bowl, along with a Super Bowl MVP.
Say now, does Ben have one of those MVP things? Huh… guess it’s not for everyone…”

4. “The Ravens are a buncha criminals!”
Response: “Let me stop you there. Here’s how this will go: you’ll say Ray Lewis, Atlanta & white suit. Then I’ll say Big Ben, bathroom stall & multiple allegations. Then you’ll say Terrell Suggs, bleach, and ex, to which I’ll reply James Harrison, door & cell phone snap.
Up next would likely be Ray Rice- which I’ll agree was several shades of wrong- but then I’ll raise you a Joey Porter, Hines Ward & throw a Jeff Reed for shiggles. We’ll continue to do this dance until we’re talking about future prospects they may take and how awful that would be.
Let’s just not. Let’s be civilized and talk about how _____.
3. Any use of the word Yinz
Response: “Can we talk about ‘Yinz’ please? Do you even know where it comes from? And please, don’t just say it comes from Pittsburgh… it’s actually of Irish-Scottish heritage as an abbreviated second person plural pronoun for ‘yous ones.’ Because we all know how often talking to friends we’re likely to say ‘hey yous ones!’ as opposed to ‘hey guys!’ or ‘fellas!’ Nope, yinz make much more sense… which is why, I suppose, yinzers are how yous ones identify yourselves in Pittsburgh. I tried googling that… here’s what I got.
“Could be worse, I suppose. Urban Dictionary is a little less subtle, suggesting a yinzer is “white trash from Western Pennsylvania” and “Extremely dumb, toothless losers that can be found in large masses watching Steeler games… Their most prized possessions are their terrible towels, which they would permanently trade in a moment’s notice for running water and soap.”
Maybe not the image yinz looking for….”
2. “(inaudible yammering) Terrible Towel!”
Response: “Neat, so ya have yourself a towel there, huh, sport?! What kinda things do you use that towel for anyways? Do you take it to the gym? Oh, the closest thing to a workout you do is pull the recline lever on the Lay-Z-Boy… well, what about like maybe any other typical towel uses, like drying your hands or a car? No?
So you just… sort of swing it around your head, but only when positive plays happen like touchdowns? Wait, you just do it arbitrarily throughout games? Even when you’re ‘bleeding the lizard’ as you call it in the bathroom at the stadium? So you bring a towel in, then wash your hands but don’t use the towel to dry them…?
Wait, why do they call it a Terrible Towel anyway? That’s kinda awful marketing, right?
Oh but there’s history? That’s neat! (Googles terrible towel) Wait, you do know the towel was literally made as a gimmick to get listeners to tune in to a radio station, right? And that they’re made in Green Bay?
No, okay see your response shouldn’t just be waving the towel over your head…”
1. “Count the Rangs!”
Response: “We get it pal, you have more rings than fingers on one hand. We also get that the Steelers have been around since 1933, whereas the Ravens have been around since 1996. No, no, no… don’t you hurt that precious noggin of yours trying to do math, I’ll get this one for you- that’s 63 years difference.
And honestly? If you’d like I can do a little more math for ya! The Ravens have 2 Super Bowls in 21 seasons, so Baltimore wins a championship roughly once a decade (that’s 10 years!).
The Steelers have 6 in 84 years, meaning they win a Super Bowl roughly once in every 14 years. A
nd wouldn’t ya know it? 14 is bigger than 10! The Ravens have less rings in less years, but win those rings at a higher rate!
Huh.. neat!”

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-science-durian/whats-that-smell-secrets-of-famously-pungent-durian-fruit-revealed-idUSKBN1CE1SB
",What’s that smell? Secrets of famously pungent durian fruit revealed,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists have answered one of nature’s most pungent questions: what gives the world’s smelliest fruit its distinctive aroma.
Scientists in Singapore said on Monday they have mapped the genome of the durian, known throughout Southeast Asia as the “king of fruits” for its unique smell, flavor and formidable spiny appearance.
They identified a group of genes responsible for odor compounds called volatile sulfur compounds, and found that these genes become highly activated as the fruit ripens, driving its unusual smell.
“The durian smell has been described as a mix of an onion-like sulfury aroma with notes of sweet fruitiness and savory soup-seasoning. A key component of the durian smell are volatile sulfur compounds, or VSCs, which have been characterized as decaying, onion-like, rotten eggs, sulfury and fried shallots,” said geneticist Bin Tean Teh, deputy director of the National Cancer Center Singapore, co-leader of the study published in the journal Nature Genetics.
Unlike other plant species that typically have one or two copies of these genes, this species boasted four copies, demonstrating that VSC production is, as Teh put it, “turbocharged” in durian fruits.
The researchers said this odor may be important to the durian in the wild, helping to attract animals to eat it and disperse its seeds.

The scientists sequenced the genome of the Musang King variety of durian, discovering it has about 46,000 genes, nearly double the number in the human genome.
They were able to trace the evolution of the fruit back 65 million years, finding an ancient relationship to the cacao tree, whose seeds produce chocolate.
“Most of us in Singapore have grown up with the durian, and we are very familiar with it,” said geneticist Patrick Tan, a professor at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. “However, even within the same family, there are individuals that love the taste, while others have learned to simply tolerate it, especially during durian season. For those who have never experienced durian before, it can indeed elicit opposing emotions of devotion and revulsion.”
Durian is eaten fresh, cooked, fermented or as an ingredient in candies, baked goods and other food.
The researchers said there are at least 30 other durian species, some edible, some inedible, and some with other distinctive features. Several are endangered.
Durian is economically important, with imports to China last year worth $600 million to $800 million, the researchers said.",1
http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/04/politics/ivanka-trump-white-house-rebrand/index.html,Ivanka Trump rebrands -- again,"Washington (CNN) For the curious observer, one of the best ways to learn more about Ivanka Trump, senior adviser to the President of the United States, was to become one of her some 3.9 million followers on Instagram . There, in color, sometimes with witty captions, were myriad photographs providing a peek behind the curtain of one of Washington's most compelling new residents.
Her three children, Arabella, 6, Joseph, 3, and Theodore, 1, were the true stars of the feed. Theodore taking his first -- documented -- crawl in the White House State Dining Room in January. Joseph pressing his face against the window glass in the Oval Office in February. Arabella catapulting herself down the White House steps outside the West Wing in April. An at-home-after-a-long-day impromptu dance party in May, Arabella in arabesque pose inside the White House China Room, with a caption from Ivanka about being ready for the weekend in June.
It was an unprecedented visual diary of a first family in modern times.
And then it stopped.
With few exceptions, Trump's family-centric social media habits have been curbed. Amid a barrage of negative press in recent weeks, Trump has shifted her strategy, instead portraying herself through the lens of her White House position. That role has changed in recent months with the installation of Ret. Gen. John Kelly as chief of staff, a move that has helped refine the first daughter's West Wing responsibilities.
The abrupt switchover from documenting all aspects of her lifestyle to almost all White House-centric posts is a curious move for Trump, for years a savvy entrepreneur and businesswoman who knows about the importance of marketing a brand.
Her streamlined image rehab signals Trump has buttoned down the private side, closing the window on observers and critics, essentially curating a new focus.
Trump had previously sought to distance herself from the chaos of the early months of the administration. The change on social media signals a furthering of that goal.
For the past several weeks, Trump's Instagram has featured ""Ivanka at work,"" rolling out fresh initiatives for STEM education, or, on Tuesday, visiting with military spouses at Camp Lejeune to talk about employment opportunities.
Today Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway and I were at Camp Lejeune to discuss the unique employment challenges faced by military spouses. The unemployment rate for military spouses is an alarming 16% and 52% of military spouses in the workforce face a wage deficit of 38% compared to their civilian peers. This Administration is deeply committed to those who serve and their families who make it possible through their love and support. We want to ensure that military spouses have every opportunity to find success in our economy and appreciate the feedback we received today on how this Administration can better serve our heroes, in and out of uniform. #CareerOnTheMove A post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Oct 3, 2017 at 12:23pm PDT
Instead of using her Instagram to document weekday museum visits and market her latest book, ""Women Who Work,"" which she did several times in summer months, Trump is now discussing policy. In early September, the hashtags in her posts said things like #CodingforKids and #TaxReform , quite a departure from #CoolMom, which she used on a post from July of Arabella visiting Vice President Mike Pence with Trump in the West Wing.
Arabella loved visiting me in the West Wing yesterday. Meeting the Vice President and Chief of Staff was the highlight of the day! #CoolMom #HallwayMeetings #WestWing A post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Jul 20, 2017 at 6:31am PDT
Testing a new course
A White House official tells CNN that Trump's zeroing-in on policy is the result of a streamlined West Wing.
""There's now a process in place,"" says the official, noting the change is thanks in large part to Kelly's hire in August. ""Because of more procedural routines and defined roles, (Trump) can pare down distractions.""
When the previous regime was in charge, particularly ex-top advisers Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon, lanes weren't as clear and the daily pace was more chaotic.
Asked about her goals, Trump answered: ""Providing opportunities, like encouraging female and minority entrepreneurship in this country. Skills training needs to start with our youngest students and include our oldest workers, who have been displaced by technology. Advocating for today's dual-income families and for paid family leave."" (She also says she gets ""goosebumps"" walking through the door of the White House.)

Trump is still showing a more personal side through her carefully crafted appearances, albeit on her own terms. Two weeks ago, she appeared on daytime talk show ""Dr. Oz,"" discussing her struggle with postpartum depression after the births of her children and revealing a vulnerability she rarely shows.
""It was a very challenging emotional time for me because I felt like I was not living up to my potential as a parent or as an entrepreneur and executive,"" Trump said. ""Look, I consider myself a very hard-charging person. I am ambitious. I'm passionate. I'm driven, but this is something that affects parents all over the country.""
Those appearances aren't always necessarily successful in defining her personal brand.
Trump spearheaded a $200 million effort rolled out at the White House last week promoting STEM and computer science education. Visiting with students last week at Middleburg Community Charter School, Trump excelled in the more personal, one-on-one interactions, including coding on a tablet alongside a fifth grade student. But when she spoke at an all-school assembly, she reverted to her White House talking points.
""I am deeply passionate about creating opportunity and eliminating barriers for people so that they can all achieve the American Dream,"" she said to the audience of 5- to 11-year-olds.

Clearly, Trump is trying to step away from the role of impotent advocate for more controversial issues, such as climate change, LGBTQ, women's health and the Syrian refugee crisis, which many political watchers had hoped she would take up as the more moderate voice in her father's administration. In September, Trump told the Financial Times that wasn't ever going to happen.
""Some people have created unrealistic expectations of what they expect from me. That my presence, in and of itself, would carry so much weight with my father that he would abandon his core values and the agenda that the American people voted for when they elected him,"" she said. ""It's not going to happen. To those critics, shy of turning my father into a liberal, I'd be a failure to them.""
Trump's target policies, while always under the vast umbrella of her portfolio, are less polarizing issues: combating human trafficking, promoting STEM and computer science education, workforce development and women's economic empowerment.
Ivanka the diplomat?
Trump has also styled herself as a diplomat of sorts within the administration in recent months, showcasing her inclusion in discussions about women's entrepreneurship and human trafficking. She has developed relationships with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, catching a Broadway show with Trudeau in March and traveling to Germany at Merkel's invitation in April for the Women 20 Summit

She briefly took the President's seat at a meeting during the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. While the move caused a stir on social media, it again signaled her interest in developing a profile on the world's stage on behalf of the administration.
And during the United Nations General Assembly last month, world leaders lined up to meet with Trump, including Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, International Committee for the Red Cross President Peter Maurer, and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, and Queen Máxima of the Netherlands. She also spoke out against human trafficking at a panel event alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May, who thanked Trump for the ""personal shared commitment"" to the issue.
Yesterday's important and impactful Call to Action at the United Nations brought together many world leaders aligned with one common goal: to end modern slavery in all of its evil forms. We must continue to work together to collectively combat this global epidemic. Thank you to UK Prime Minister May and UN Secretary General Guterres for your leadership and enduring commitment to this critical mission. #USAatUNGA #UNGA #EndTrafficking A post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Sep 20, 2017 at 2:00pm PDT
Later this fall, she will represent the US abroad again, traveling to India to lead the US delegation to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit.
A barrage of bad press
Trump's image rebranding comes amid an intensifying barrage of negative headlines. Paparazzi are a near-constant presence outside her home in Northwest Washington.
Her husband Jared Kushner's involvement in the 2016 campaign is part of ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the election, and the scrutiny only intensified over the summer.
Politico reported earlier this week that White House accounts sent internal White House documents to an email address shared by Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and their household staff. The couple had previously exchanged emails with White House officials about government business using their personal email addresses. The Politico report revealed that they also used a third email address on their private domain to communicate with White House officials.
Trump insists she doesn't read any of the coverage about herself.
""No. If I engaged too deeply, I wouldn't be able to prioritize the things I came here to do,"" she told Us Weekly.
""But it must get to you,"" the magazine's reporter said.
""Oh, all the time!"" Trump responded. ""It requires tremendous discipline to ignore the noise.""",1

Later on that evening a friend came over and pointed out something creepy in the photo.
 
There was a mysterious figure in a purple dress that was seen in the background. She was sitting down with her hands folded on her lap.
 
 “A friend of mine came to my house that night and pointed out what looks to be a woman with her hands folded on her knees in the background, bearing in mind the picture was taken facing the living room door,” said Harvey.
 
Harvey insists there was no one else in the home when they took this photo.
 
 “A lot of creepy things have happened in this house,” Harvey said. “I don’t go into the living room in the dark anymore because I fear I might see something.”

",Yemenis See Turning Point After Ousting Qaeda Militants in South,"Here and elsewhere in the country’s central and southern regions, American-backed Yemeni forces have been waging a shadow war against more than 3,000 members of the Qaeda affiliate and their tribal fighters. Since Feb. 28, the United States has conducted more than 100 airstrikes against Qaeda militants in Yemen, according to the Pentagon, nearly three times the total for all of last year.
The Yemenis in recent weeks have also captured some important Qaeda operatives. Their interrogations have given the Yemeni forces and their American and Emirati partners valuable insights into the insurgents’ leadership hierarchy, propaganda plans and local networks, a United States official said.
Here in Azzan, Mr. Wahidi said that residents had been tipped off about the impending attack by homegrown troops in the advancing force. “Those are our sons,” Mr. Wahidi said as he reclined on a hard pillow and chewed khat, the narcotic leaves widely consumed in Yemen and the Horn of Africa. “Most of the soldiers graduated from Azzan secondary school.”
The night before, residents said, warplanes hovered over the town and dropped flash bombs at suspected Qaeda militants gathering in the nearby mountains. Ahead of their arrival, the Yemeni troops also fired machine guns that rocked the town, another tactic to scare the militants.
As the insurgents melted away, the Yemenis marched toward a military camp on a small hill overlooking Azzan that the Qaeda fighters had used. Mohammad Al Qumishi, the commander of the forces, locally known as Shabwani Elite Forces, bragged about the success of his troops in hunting down senior Qaeda operatives in Shabwa.
“We have captured eight big heads,” said Mr. Qumishi, adding that local residents who sold arms to Al Qaeda were released after pledging to no longer deal with the militants.

The Shabwani force is made up of 4,000 local tribesmen who fought off Shiite militia in northern Yemen in 2015. The forces were trained by Emirati military instructors in a desert area of nearby Hadramout Province, and took orders from the Emiratis during the recent offensive. An unidentified number of other troops are being trained in the same area.

Months before, the Emirati trainers promised local tribal leaders that the Emirati Red Crescent would dole out money to revive crumbled social services if the local fighters helped push Al Qaeda from their territory. The elders agreed, and the town’s main schools and hospital were painted on time, but teachers and other public servants who would run these facilities say they have not been paid in several months.
Yemen analysts say counterterrorism may not be the only motive driving the offensive here. Shabwa is home to major oil and gas facilities that are being reopened and involve international companies, which means commercial interests may also be at stake, said Elisabeth Kendall, a Yemen scholar at the University of Oxford who visited the country in August.

That said, Ms. Kendall noted that there are clear signs that the offensive has put a dent in Al Qaeda’s fortunes. The group publicly warned residents in August against joining the Emirati-led Yemeni forces. “It attempts to merge A.Q.A.P.’s religious agenda with local tribal concerns, distilling a complex political landscape into a simple apocalyptic battle of good guys versus bad guys,” she said, referring to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
The streets of Azzan, a commercial gathering place for thousands of people from four neighboring districts in Shabwa, are unpaved and dusty. Trash covers the ground, the result of years of uncollected garbage. Electricity works for only about five hours a day. Water is also unavailable most of the day. On working days, Azzan is packed with thousands of shoppers; during the weekend in Yemen, the streets are nearly empty except for some passing African immigrants.
Tough-looking soldiers manning two checkpoints at the entrance to the town carefully check cars and search for weapons or cameras. Armed tribesmen must relinquish their guns if they wish to enter. Celebratory gunfire during nighttime weddings was banned. The result is that security has improved for the first time in years, residents said.
The town has held significance since 2011, when Qaeda militants seized control here, exploiting a security vacuum as the government of Yemen’s long-serving president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, faced major protests during the Arab Spring calling for his ouster.
Yemeni government forces launched a major military offensive and recaptured the town in 2012. The militants withdrew to the mountains and from there plotted a deadly counteroffensive.
The militants reclaimed Azzan in 2013, but this time under the pretext of stopping thugs who had robbed and killed local people. At the same time, the militants made concerted efforts to fix public services like electricity, water and sanitation. Steel trash bins brought in by the Qaeda fighters are still scattered in the city’s dirty streets.
In 2014, Yemen’s army launched yet another offensive and retook the town. In the following months, militants mounted relentless attacks against government forces. Pockmarked houses still bear the scars of these heavy gun battles. Part of the city’s main hospital, built during the British reign before 1967, was leveled by airstrikes. Wealthy residents left their ruined houses standing in the hope of receiving promised compensation from the government.

When a Saudi-led coalition began a new bombing campaign against the militants in 2015, security and vital services crumbled, opening a vacuum that enabled Al Qaeda to make another comeback. Residents said that the militants did not declare Azzan an Islamic emirate as they had in the past, instead sending operatives to the town to kidnap security personnel.
Most residents said they abhorred the militants, but a few still speak highly of the strict order they imposed and the amenities they provided. “They brought back peace and put an end to robbery and theft,” said Abdul Rahman Al Ashmali, whose relative was kidnapped by Al Qaeda in 2013. “Power and water services were available all the time.”
Qaeda militants who ruled Azzan are now hiding in the Saeed region, a rugged area in the Shabwa and Moudea districts in Abyan Province, about 50 miles west of here, said Mr. Qumishi, the Yemeni commander. “Several months ago, they pulled all of their arms and important documents from Azzan as they were predicting our arrival,” he said.",1

(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
We have our first week where we truly have to maneuver around bye weeks, and when coupled with a few injuries (Derek Carr and Marcus Mariota) Week 5 looks to be the most complicated we’ve had to date. Let’s try to sort through all of the questions as we breakdown our rankings for the coming week:
Tom Brady – New England Patriots – at Tampa Bay Aaron Rodgers – Green Bay Packers – at Dallas Russell Wilson – Seattle Seahawks – at Los Angeles Rams Jameis Winston – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New England Cam Newton – Carolina Panthers – at Detroit Carson Wentz – Philadelphia Eagles – vs. Arizona Matthew Stafford – Detroit Lions – vs. Carolina Dak Prescott – Dallas Cowboys – vs. Green Bay Carson Palmer – Arizona Cardinals – at Philadelphia Alex Smith – Kansas City Chiefs – at Houston Eli Manning – New York Giants – vs. Los Angeles Chargers Philip Rivers – Los Angeles Chargers – at New York Giants Deshaun Watson – Houston Texans – vs. Kansas City Jacoby Brissett – Indianapolis Colts – vs. San Francisco Josh McCown – New York Jets – at Cleveland Jay Cutler – Miami Dolphins – vs. Tennessee Tyrod Taylor – Buffalo Bills – at Cincinnati Marcus Mariota – Tennessee Titans – at Miami Ben Roethlisberger – Pittsburgh Steelers – vs. Jacksonville Andy Dalton – Cincinnati Bengals – vs. Buffalo Jared Goff – Los Angeles Rams – vs. Seattle Blake Bortles – Jacksonville Jaguars – at Pittsburgh Joe Flacco – Baltimore Ravens – at Oakland Deshone Kizer – Cleveland Browns – vs. New York Jets Brian Hoyer – San Francisco 49ers – at Indianapolis
Thoughts:
We saw Cam Newton’s 2017 breakout come in Week 4 against the New England Patriots, so you have to love the upside of Jameis Winston in Week 5. He has been impressive through his first three games, as he’s completing 63.0% of his passes (which would be his career best) to go along with 864 yards and 6 TD. He’s exceeded 325 yards in each of the past two weeks, and he could be looking at a third straight. Consider him a Top 5 option.
Speaking of Newton he threw for 316 yards, 3 TD and 1 INT in Week 4 and also rushed for another TD. The Detroit Lions do represent a bit of a tougher matchup (fourth fewest points per week to opposing quarterbacks), but that’s solely because they’ve given up little on the ground as well as limited opposing QB to 4 TD vs. 7 INT. They have allowed the ninth most passing yards (1,020) and Newton could easily help to drastically change their overall outlook. Consider him a viable QB1.
Deshaun Watson is coming off a big day, throwing for 283 yards, 4 TD and 1 INT (while also adding a rushing TD). He’s now thrown for 584 yards and 6 TD over the past two weeks, but a matchup with the Chiefs will not be an easy one. He’s more of a high-end QB2, as opposed to a trustworthy QB1.
It would be easy to get behind Ben Roethlisberger, but the Jaguars are allowing the fewest points per week to opposing quarterbacks. As the Jets helped to expose on Sunday where you can gash Jacksonville is on the ground, which points to another big day from Le’Veon Bell.
The change in offensive coordinator has obviously had a positive impact on Andy Dalton, who has now thrown for 6 TD vs. 0 INT over the past two weeks. The Bills represent a tough matchup, having allowed 1 TD vs. 6 INT and giving up the second fewest points per week to opposing quarterbacks. It’s easy to get excited, and there’s reason to believe, but he’s more of a QB2 for this one.

",Washington Post Fails To Cover Amazon Nearly $300 Million Dollar Fine For Tax Dodging,"By Aaron Kesel
The Washington Post, owned by the same man who owns Amazon, Jeff Bezos, failed to cover the recent nearly $300 million dollar fine against the corporate retail giant, blacking out the story that its boss’s other organization reaped illegal tax benefits for 8 long years.
Amazon was ordered by the European Commission to pay the fine after it was found to have received illegal tax benefits.
The commission stated that Amazon received the illegal benefits between 2006 and 2014 in the country without any “valid justification.”
“Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon. As a result, almost three-quarters of Amazon’s profits were not taxed,” Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s commissioner for competition, said in a statement.
“In other words, Amazon was allowed to pay four times less tax than other local companies subject to the same national tax rules. This is illegal under EU state aid rules. Member states cannot give selective tax benefits to multinational groups that are not available to others,” she added.
.@amazon tax benefits in Luxembourg are illegal under our common European rules on state aid. Amazon to repay benefits worth around €250 mio — Margrethe Vestager (@vestager) October 4, 2017
“$300 million fine against AMAZON for tax dodge in EU…nothing on Washington Post front page?” Matt Drudge tweeted Wednesday, adding a mocking comment of WAPO’s catchphrase “Democracy dies in darkness.” “Democracy dies…with monopolistic Bezos!!,” Drudge tweeted.
$300M fine against AMAZON for tax dodge in EU… Nothing on https://t.co/XoVevZ1tgf front page? Democracy Dies… with monopolistic Bezos!! — MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) October 4, 2017
Amazon said in response to the commission’s decision that it believes it did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg, that it paid tax in “full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law” and was considering an appeal:
“We will study the Commission’s ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal. Our 50,000 employees across Europe remain heads-down focused on serving our customers and the hundreds of thousands of small businesses who work with us,” the online retailing giant said in a statement to Bloomberg.
U.S. President Donald Trump has previously accused Bezos of tax dodging in several tweets and while on Fox during his run for the presidency last year.
“He thinks I’ll go after him for antitrust,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity last year. “Because he’s got a huge antitrust problem because he’s controlling so much, Amazon is controlling so much of what they are doing.” “He’s using the Washington Post, which is peanuts, he’s using that for political purposes to save Amazon in terms of taxes and in terms of antitrust,” he added.
The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2017
The @washingtonpost, which loses a fortune, is owned by @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015
Trump’s claim that Amazon pays no “internet taxes,” is partially true and is therefore “fake news.”
While it’s true that the online retailer built its huge market share via tax avoidance, Amazon began collecting sales tax nationwide on April 1st earlier this year.
The Luxembourg government stated it “considers that the company has not been granted incompatible State aid.”
The ruling is further indication that the EU is finally going after big corporations for tax dodging.
Last year, Apple was ordered to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes, just like Amazon.
The EU authority further announced that it was suing Ireland for failing to recover any money from that fine from Apple Inc.
“Ireland has to recover up to 13 billion euros in illegal State aid from Apple. However, more than one year after the Commission adopted this decision, Ireland has still not recovered the money, also not in part,” said Vestager in a statement. She added: “We of course understand that recovery in certain cases may be more complex than in others, and we are always ready to assist. But Member States need to make sufficient progress to restore competition. That is why we have today decided to refer Ireland to the EU Court for failing to implement our decision.”
Additionally, earlier this year Google was ordered to pay $2.7 billion dollars by Vestager earlier this year in an antitrust lawsuit for promoting its own shopping service over rivals.
While Google also faced a 170 million dollar fine last year from British tax authorities and agreed to pay that lump sum in back taxes for all the years the company under paid.

Deep State is getting very desperate
 
Here’s how we know: “Deadliest Mass Shooting In US History”: At Least 58 Killed, 515 Injured After Shooter Opens Fire At Las Vegas Concert
Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More...
 
Special Note:
 This extremely well planned and covered up domestic terrorist attack was obviously a false flag operation. However, it was NOT a hoax and this video proves it. In other words, the mass shooting has already been blamed on a disillusioned white guy yet many in attendance have reported multiple shooting locations; so we know it’s a false flag as usual. The patsy is always either killed or commits suicide just before his capture. (Las Vegas massacre suspect Stephen Paddock committed suicide) This tactic quickly closes the book so that the real perpetrators will never be pursued. Again, some are calling this tragic event a hoax; it’s not. Many have died and hundreds are seriously wounded. SOTN extends our deepest condolences to each and every one of their families.
 
 
Like so many other staged mass casualty events, this [SHOCKING] shooting staged at the “country music concert in Las Vegas” was deliberate and multi-purposeful.
 
Because of the immediate floating of a lone-wolf shooter, it’s clear that a patsy was pre-identified to take the rap. Las Vegas Shooting Framed As Lone Wolf With 20 Dead And 100 wounded!
 
 
Though there were initial reports of multiple shooters and multiple incidents up and down the Strip, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said at a press conference held at 1:30 a.m. local time that it was believed that there was only one suspect.
 
That man was killed on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay after officers responded to the shooting. Lombardo said that investigators are looking for the suspect’s roommate, an Asian woman named Marilou Danley.
 
Lombardo declined to identify the suspect, who he called a “lone wolf.”
 
Asked about the shooter’s motive, Lombardo said, “We don’t know what his belief system was at this time.”
 (Source: Massacre At Mandalay: Las Vegas Gunman Kills At Least 20 At Country Music Concert [VIDEO])
 
 
The crime scene hasn’t even been thoroughly investigated and the local county sheriff has already called this false flag mass shooting a lone-wolf operation! That, right there, is a dead giveaway.
 
KEY POINT: Why was the stage in Vegas re-illuminated after it went dark which enabled the shooter to see the crowd? (Video) WHO HAD THEIR HAND ON THAT LIGHT SWITCH? See for yourself in this indisputable video.
 
There is also an increasing trend over the past couple of years whereby these BIG false flag operations are executed at night. The cover of darkness gives the real perps so much more opportunity to cover their tracks and manipulate the crime scene to fit their predetermined narrative.
 
Why did they do it?
 
Things have not been going well for the globalists. Their New World Order agenda is in complete disarray.
 
First, the NFL Kneelgate scandal has really back fired…so much so that the NWO ruling cabal has to change the national conversation. Nothing does that quicker than a mass casualty event (MCE). The NFL crashes and burns! Collapse of the celebrity culture now inevitable.
 
With the NFL in a free-fall collapse, the globalists were forced to divert the attention of the American people. The institutional responses to the NFL fiasco were particularly impactful with NASCAR completely rejecting the practice of kneeling during the anthem. The NBA likewise sent out a memo banning the same form of protest both individually and collectively. NBA memo warns teams to stand during national anthem ‘OR ELSE’
 
This sudden reversal of fortune for the globalists was both embarrassing and unexpected which demanded an expeditious response … … … like a horrifying MCE in their view.
 
Post MARIA Disaster in Puerto Rico
 
There’s no question that the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico has been transformed into an unparalleled disaster area. The extent of the human catastrophe alone is still unknown because of the inability to get to many parts of the devastated island. Many are unaware that Puerto Rico has experienced 2 major superstorm hits: first from Hurricane Irma; then from Hurricane Maria– the first category 4 to hit the island since 1932.
 
The key point is that Puerto Rico has been evolving in the direction of a major political football. The Democrats, especially, are attempting to seize any political advantage they can in an effort to tarnish President Trump with his first “Katrina”. SOTN is writing an investigative report on the reality in Puerto Rico and the extent of the political subterfuge being used by the locals. The Democratic San Juan mayor seems to be a major player in these machinations, although a verdict on her official conduct cannot yet be rendered conclusively.
 
Is the San Juan Mayor blocking hurricane relief or are logistics in Puerto Rico really impossible?
 
 
San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz,
 
The bottom line here is that the globalists are clearly using the island Democrats to sabotage Trump’s relief effort. However, the Alt Media is catching some of the more obvious acts of subversion in real time. This is making the cabal’s plan to ruin Trump’s reputation as a compassionate nationalist quite difficult to execute.
 
With each passing day, successive Trump’s tweetstorms expose this perfidious globalist scheme. Thus, the NWO cabal is compelled to rapidly change the conversation. This is where MCE events like Las Vegas get the job done faster than anything.
 
Major distraction needed because of highly successful Catalonia referendum
 
Whenever the NWO cabal needs to abruptly change the Internet buzz about an historic happening, such as the overwhelming vote for independence in Catalonia, they reflexively do a terror attack somewhere in the world.
 
First, it’s critical to understand just how big this referendum was in terms of the people exercising raw political power. Not only did 89% of the citizens vote Catalonia out of Spain, they held the vote under dire threats issued by the Interior Ministry in Madrid. The Results Are In: 89% Of Catalans Vote For Independence
 
The people of Catalonia really want out of the Kingdom of Spain, as it’s officially known. However, the Spanish Government is even more desperate to keep the Catalans in the nation for many reasons which are outside of the scope of this article. Those reasons, incidentally border on a very serious existential crisis that this referendum only exacerbated, and greatly so!
 
Then there is the ongoing EU problem. This “Yes” vote by Catalans for independence, where it concerns the future of the European Union, will serve to stoke the fires of emancipation of all Europeans who correctly perceive their superstate as a tyrannical and totalitarian supranational entity. EU Exposé: A Planned Totalitarian Superstate to Destroy Europe
 
Therefore, it ought to be easy to understand why the globalists in Brussels had to changethe spotlight that has been focused on Catalonia throughout their highly consequential and dramatic voting process. Not only was Madrid extremely heavy-handed in attempting to thwart a legitimate vote, they committed unheard crimes against the people which shocked Spain, Europe and the world-at large.
 
Why did TPTB choose a country music concert in Vegas for their massacre?
 
There are actually many reasons why they carried out this bloodbath at this particular venue. Video: LAS VEGAS SHOOTING: HORRIFYING FOOTAGE CAUGHT ON CAMERA
 
As always, the globalists want to take guns from every American citizen. An armed America is the single greatest obstacle toward the establishment of their planned One World Government.
 
Even more concerning for the power elite is the absolute necessity of disarming the populace BEFORE the controlled demolition of the Global Economic and Financial System. They are well aware, given the raw truth routinely disseminated on the Internet, that the wealthy elites will be in the crosshairs of every patriot, nationalist and militiaman. Not only is the truth out there about the wholesale theft of America’s future by the NWO cabal, anyone who cares to find out exactly who is accountable for the multi-decade crime spree can simply surf the net.
 
Of course, taking down a LOT of innocent country music fans who tend to be conservative and Christian, patriots and nationalists, Trumpsters and Tea Partiers, was an attempt to sway them toward gun control. The delusion of the globalist was that if the NRA members and hunters were so appalled by this incomparable slaughter perpetrated by multiple snipers in Vegas, they just might demand some form of substantial gun control legislation for their own protection.
 
Then there is the intention to punish the ever-politically incorrect patriot movement. Bringing such deadly mayhem to a country music venue sends the unequivocal message that the perps can duplicate the unspeakable carnage anywhere, anytime they want to in similar music settings around the country.
 
There is much more to this strategy which derives directly from NATO’s Operation Gladio. This ongoing “strategy of tension” has been systematically implemented in Europe over decades for the purpose of terrorizing targeted civilian populations in order to produce a specific outcome. NATO’s Secret Armies. Operation GLADIO and the Strategy of Tension
 
Government-coordinated false flags are now legal
 
How do the FEDs get away with so many in-your-face attacks on the American people?
 
These exceedingly violent MCEs have actually been made ‘legal’ by the most recent version of the NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act), that was aggressively pushed under Obama.
 
Yes, this legislation may sound totally insane, and it is; but it is also enshrined by legislation passed by Congress and signed by Obama. As follows:
 
“FALSE FLAGS” are LEGAL PROPAGANDA PRODUCED by the Department of Defense
 
The unending spate of mass shootings and bombings is a direct result of this fundamentally unconstitutional and unlawful federal statute. And hardly anyone knows about it!
 
Conclusion
 
As this Las Vegas PsyOp continues to unravel in the days ahead, other objectives will make themselves clear.
 
The very fact that so many were apparently killed and wounded makes this a classic black operation conducted by the C.I.A. in close cooperation with the F.B.I. and local law enforcement.
 
Whenever an MCE is analyzed so quickly as a lone-wolf mass murder, who could not possibly have shot so many people so swiftly, the U.S. Intelligence Community is obviously behind the whole charade.
 
Does Deep State really expect US to believe that the “National Security State” is incapable of detecting such transparent acts of domestic terrorism?
 
Note
 
The following video makes clear that at least one person had definitive foreknowledge of this tragic mass shooting in Las Vegas. How did she know? What did she know? Who is she and where is she now? And why did the authorities usher her out so quickly?!

"http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/03/media/tom-petty-death-media/index.html
",Tom Petty's daughter angered over death report,"Tom Petty died on Monday night, but inaccurate news of his death made its way around the internet much earlier in the day.
According to Tony Dimitriades, longtime manager of Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, the legendary rocker ""died peacefully at 8:40 pm PT surrounded by family, his bandmates and friends"" after suffering cardiac arrest.
That was hours after some media outlets had already reported on his death -- a mistake that prompted one of Petty's daughters to vent her anger about it on social media.
Tom Petty dies at 66
An Instagram account believed to belong to AnnaKim Violet Petty featured a post with a blistering message to Rolling Stone magazine, which reported Petty had died on Monday afternoon.
""My dad is not dead yet but your f***ing magazine is,"" the post read.
""How dare you report that my father has died just to get press because your articles and photos are so dated,"" Petty added with a picture of her father on the cover of a 1980 issue of Rolling Stone. ""This is my father not a celebrity. An artist and human being.""
Petty's daughter and Rolling Stone did not respond to CNNMoney's request for comment on this story.
She started posting photos of her father on Sunday and continued throughout Monday. In one post that included the song lyrics to ""All Right For Now,"" Petty wrote ""thank you for all the love.""
The stream of heartfelt tributes was interrupted only by her remarks about Rolling Stone.
💜thank you for the love A post shared by Ilovemyfamily (@inviteloveinvitelove) on Oct 2, 2017 at 11:06pm PDT
TMZ, citing law enforcement sources, was first to post a story Petty had been hospitalized.
""We're told after Petty got to the hospital he had no brain activity and a decision was made to pull life support,"" TMZ reported at 3:30 pm ET on Monday.
At 4 p.m. ET, CBS News, citing Los Angeles Police, tweeted that Petty had died and included a link to an obituary.

Variety published a collection of some of the tweets mourning Petty.
""The singer is not expected to live through the day, but he's still clinging to life,"" TMZ reported at 4:35 p.m. ET.
News outlets began correcting their reporting. The Los Angeles Police Department tweeted an apology.
""The LAPD has no information about the passing of singer Tom Petty. Initial information was inadvertently provided to some media sources,"" the tweets read. ""However, the LAPD has no investigative role in this matter. We apologize for any inconvenience in this reporting.""

",Review: A Cheery Portrait of Severe Disability in ‘Breathe’,"Photo
Living with polio seems like jolly good fun in “Breathe,” an aggressively tasteful and rigorously cheerful biopic of the English disability-rights pioneer Robin Cavendish (Andrew Garfield) and his devoted wife, Diana (Claire Foy).
After contracting the disease in the 1950s at the age of 28, Cavendish, paralyzed from the neck down and expected to live only a few months, not only beat those odds by almost 40 years, but regained his independence. He was also instrumental in helping other severely disabled patients regain theirs, collaborating with his friend Teddy (Hugh Bonneville), an amateur inventor, to design a wheelchair with a built-in ventilator and traveling to Europe to promote its use.
This exceptional life, however, is smothered by a cloying fairy tale romance that turns every challenge the couple faces into a lark. (Silly dog, unplugging Daddy’s breathing machine!) Their charmed existence includes a huge country house, a free nanny and friends who are forever popping over for wine-soaked parties. Not even a broken respirator, which strands the family on a Spanish roadside, can halt the fun: Within minutes, an impromptu fiesta, complete with guitarists and flamenco dancers, has materialized to keep them company.
Offering no hint of the backbreaking drudgery and mental strain of their predicament, this gauzy picture (produced by the couple’s son, Jonathan Cavendish, and directed by his friend, the actor Andy Serkis) is a closed loop of rose-tinted memories. Similarly constrained, Mr. Garfield smiles broadly through episodes of near-suffocation and bloody sputum, while Ms. Foy embodies the buck-up-and-carry-on mentality that William Nicholson’s screenplay demands.
In only one scene do we feel genuinely moved, as Robin and Diana visit a German hospital where polio patients are housed in a futuristic nightmare of iron-lung efficiency. It’s a rebel moment of chillingly authentic horror that seems to have slipped through every bad-feeling filter the filmmakers have installed. For a movie about an extraordinary couple who rarely played it safe, “Breathe” is all too content to do just that.",1

Business is business and while I personally don’t like to see how Derek Jeter is handling the Marlins early on here, that’s his business, and he doesn’t care what I think… and to be honest, I know that after I wrote DEREK JERK-ER, neither do you. But I have a platform and you don’t. Conversation and debate is healthy though. My last Jeter headline was provocative, and you guys pounced on me like I pounced on DJ. All good… as long as the convo is healthy and not hateful… I’m all in. Thanks for the banter.
Here’s the latest from Miami Herald:
“Jeter asked Samson to dismiss vice president of player development Marc DelPiano, assistant general manager Mike Berger, vice president/player personnel Jeff McAvoy and vice president/pitching development Jim Benedict. All were informed by Samson in recent days.”
But here’s what got me next…
“Jeter has not informed manager Don Mattingly if he will be retained, but that is widely expected by members of the organization.”
Now while this line doesn’t say Donnie will be canned… there’s no way of knowing until it happens.
But then that got my mind starting to think about Jeet and the Core Four and the Yankee connection in Miami, if any, and wondering… would long time friend Jorge Posada be a guy that Jeet would hire for that clubhouse? Gerald Williams? Hell… what’s Andy Pettitte doing these days?
I know Jeter wants to impress in Miami, and get a winning team and all of that, but I was annoyed originally when he canned all the former Marlins “icons” and Hall of Famers because for me, that was part of the charm and marketing of the Marlins. Is Jeet gonna replace them with personalities or will it be more old white guys in charge? I wonder if Jorge is coming? I wonder if there is a meaning to his madness.
Who knows… I just find his new job interesting, and it’s strange, but fun to watch.

http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/italian-effort-stop-migrants-fuels-bloody-battle-libya-50298950,Italian effort to stop migrants fuels bloody battle in Libya,"It began when a Libyan militia paid by Italy to stop migrants heading to Europe intercepted a group of human traffickers offshore. That confrontation has spiraled into a weeks-long battle among rival militias for control of a Libyan coastal city that has left dozens dead.
The bloodshed in the city of Sabratha is in part an unexpected consequence of Europe's effort to stem the flow of migrants from Libya across the Mediterranean. It illustrates how easily things can escalate out of control in the chaos of the North African country, where three different governments claim authority and the real power in many areas lies with local militias.
The Sabratha fight has expanded, bringing in outside factions, including Khalifa Hifter, the strongman who controls eastern Libya and is a rival of the weak, internationally recognized government based in Tripoli, headed by Fayez Serraj. Hifter appears to be using the conflict to obtain a foothold in the western part of the country.
Thousands of families have fled Sabratha, according to the Red Crescent and local officials. Fighting has endangered the city's dramatic antiquity site — the remains of a 1,800-year-old Roman city. At one point, a militia besieged opposing fighters holed up inside the ruins, with snipers positioned on top of the monuments. Photos on line showed bullet holes in one monument.
""This is a war that started between human traffickers, then snowballed into an ideological and political one,"" said al-Tahar al-Gharabili, head of the Sabratha Military Council, which answers to Serraj's government.
Over the summer, Italy began funneling cash and logistical support to two major militias in Sabratha after they agreed to stop their involvement in human trafficking and instead act as a police force against it, stopping migrant boats. The deal was made through Serraj's government, and the two militias — the Martyr Anas al-Dabashi militia, better known as al-Ammu's militia, and Brigade 48 — were nominally turned into arms of its security forces.
The deal led to a dramatic drop in migration from Sabratha, a city on the western side of Libya's Mediterranean coast that used to be the main launching point for migrant boats.
But voices in Libya decried the deal, fearing that the salaries and supplies would enrich the militias and make them more powerful. The boost to one side threw off the balance of power in Sabratha, triggering a backlash from other local militias.
Al-Gharabili said the conflict began when, last month, a force from the al-Ammu militia clashed with traffickers off shore, thwarting an attempt to move multiple boat-loads of migrants.
The traffickers came from the al-Wadi district, in eastern Sabratha. Because of al-Ammu's crackdown, hundreds of migrants had been stuck in al-Wadi unable to leave, and the traffickers were desperate to move them, al-Gharabili said. ""The situation exploded,"" he said.
The next day, Sept. 17, a paramilitary force allied to al-Wadi opened fire on members of al-Ammu's militia, killing one and wounding others.
Since then, at least 93 people have been killed, including eight civilians, and more than 180 wounded in battles that have carved up the city, according to Essam Karrar, the head of Sabratha Civil Society Federation.
Fighting the past few days has been more intense even than during the 2011 civil war, al-Gharabili said, as militias this week tried to capture al-Ammu's headquarters, a former resort called Shahrazad. Hospitals, hotels and homes have been hit.
The core of the conflict is between al-Ammu and Brigade 48 militias on one side and, on the other, the al-Wadi militia and the Anti-ISIS Operation Room, a force of army officers created to fight the Islamic State group.
All the factions involved are nominally under the authority of Serraj's government — underscoring how little power it actually has over any of them.
Bashir Ibrahim, the al-Ammu spokesman, acknowledged that the deal with Italy was one trigger of the Sabratha fighting. ""Certainly, this is among the reasons,"" he said. ""It's about power.""
Al-Ammu's opponents depict it as a ""terrorist"" group linked to Islamist factions and portray themselves as seeking to re-establish state control and stop trafficking.
An al-Wadi spokesman, Hussein al-Alagi, called the Italian deal a ""disaster"" that reinforces a ""bunch of criminals and terrorists.""
An Operations Room spokesman, Saleh Graisia, told the AP that the time has come to ""remove the tumor that has been growing in Sabratha,"" referring to the al-Ammu militia.
The fight has grown more complicated as Hifter has thrown his support to the forces fighting al-Ammu. In a statement to the Italian media outlet ADNkronos, HIfter said the fighting in Sabratha was a ""legitimate war"" against armed groups ""that embrace terrorism and human trafficking.""
Hifter is backed by the eastern-based parliament that is the rival of Serraj's government, and he has spoken in the past of moving into the west. He has also sought to boost his legitimacy in international eyes, urging Europe to support him as a force to stop migration across the Mediterranean.
A Hifter spokesman, Col. Ali al-Mosmari, vowed on Twitter that the assault would continue ""until the whole city is terrorist-free.""
Al-Gharabili said Hifter is working closely with the Anti-ISIS Operation Room, something the group's spokesman denies. One of his top commanders recently visited the Operation Room, and another senior Hifter associate recruited men from the area to create a force fighting alongside it, al-Gharabili said.
Also, the al-Wadi militia is believed to be made up of ultraconservative Salafi Islamists known as the Madkhalis who are longtime allies of Hifter in the east. Al-Alaqi said the force is made up of ""moderate Muslims"" and denied it has direct contact with Hifter, saying they only share ""common interests""
Al-Gharabili said he believes Hifter is trying to gain influence in western Libya as leverage in talks with Serraj's government, perhaps ultimately hoping to control of Sabratha, a nearby oil facility and the border crossing into Tunisia further west.
He said Serraj's Defense Ministry has ordered the creation of a force from fighters around the west to move into Sabratha and stop the fighting.
""This is no longer a Sabratha war, it's the entire western region,"" he said.
It also leaves uncertain the future of Europe's effort to stop migrants by enlisting local forces.
Ibrahim from al-Ammu lamented that fighting has turned brother against brother in Sabratha. Members of the large al-Dabashi family belong to factions on both sides.
""Sabratha is like a mosaic. You arrange it in a way that give you a beautiful picture or in a way that turns very ugly just like now,"" he said.",1
http://www.disclose.tv/news/earth_must_be_warned__french_astronauts_chilling_warning_resurfaced_this_week/136450,'Earth Must be Warned!' - French Astronaut's Chilling Warning Resurfaced This Week,"Claudie André-Deshays Haigneré is at the center of an enormous mystery. In 2008, the talented and highly intelligent Frenchwoman issued a hysterical warning to the people of Earth after attempting to commit suicide. No one at the time knew what the warning meant and since Dr. Haigneré has recovered she has refused to clarify the matter.
 
She was working on researching involving human and alien DNA
 
Dr. Haigneré is an extraordinarily accomplished woman who has enjoyed a storied and multi-faceted career. She is a rheumatologist and has a Ph.D. in neuroscience and certificates in biology, sports medicine, aviation and space medicine. In 1993, she traveled to space for the first time and became the first European woman to visit the International Space Station along with her husband who is also an astronaut.
 
After her travels in space, Dr. Haigneré entered French politics and served as a minster for Research and New Technologies between 2002 and 2004. She was also the minister for European Affairs between 2004 and 2005. Despite her efforts, while she was in office the budget for scientific research in France were cut. Disillusioned, she cut her political career short and went to work in a biology lab at the prestigious Pasteur Institute.
 
Sources have reported that Dr. Haigneré’s work at the Pasteur Institute was of a rather esoteric nature. Some have even claimed that she was working on researching involving human and alien DNA. After several years at the Pasteur Institute, it was widely reported that Dr. Haigneré was taken to hospital after taking a huge overdose of sleeping pills. She was conscious upon arrival but had to be forcibly restrained as she fought against doctors, screaming “Earth must be warned!” Shortly after that, she lapsed into a coma.
 
 
Immediately after this extraordinary scene, it was reported that there was a mysterious fire which has never been properly explained by workers at the Pasteur Institute which has raised suspicions that Dr. Haigneré came across something groundbreaking and deeply disturbing in the course of her research. However, if this is the case, Dr. Haigneré is not willing to speak publicly about it anymore. She has blamed her suicide attempt on ‘burnout syndrome’ and has now moved on to the directorship of the largest science museum in Europe, the Cité des Sciences et de l’Industrie.

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio held a press conference in Phoenix on Thursday afternoon where he announced after a five year investigation his investigators have determined that the birth certificate presented by President Barack Obama was a fraudulently created document which has been represented as an official copy of the original certificate. The Sheriff’s office said they have been working this case since August 2011 after the Tea Party asked him to investigate. “We had to follow the evidence,” Arpaio said during the press briefing. The lead investigator, Mike Zullo, presented a video which claimed to show the Obama birth certificate shows “9 points of forgery.” He says they consulted several experts from all across the world including in Italy. We will post the video here as soon as we get it. In the meantime, you can watch the press conference live. WATCH PRESS CONFERENCE LIVE NOW: The investigators took aim at the media for the way they have characterized their investigation. “You have continued to mischaracterized this.. This was not about where President Obama was born. This was about his birth certificate,” said the Maricopa County public information officer. “I didn’t want to be the guy that figured everything out, I wanted it to be the clearinghouse,” Zullo said during the press briefing. 84-year-old Arpaio lost his reelection bid in November to the Democratic contender. The sheriff is among the last high-profile “birthers” left, who question whether the President was born in the United States. Former birther President-elect Donald Trump held his own presser during his campaign, where he acknowledged that President Obama was indeed born in this country, and that he indeed had a legitimate birth certificate.

Judge formally dismisses Arpaio’s criminal case
 
 
 
A federal judge has upheld the validity of former Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s pardon despite claims from critics that letting his clemency stand would encourage officials to disobey future court orders.
 
Judge Susan Bolton cited U.S. Supreme Court precedent Wednesday when she formally dismissed the criminal case against the former six-term sheriff of metro Phoenix.
 
Two months ago, Bolton found Arpaio guilty of disobeying a court order to stop his traffic patrols that targeted immigrants.
 
The ruling comes five weeks after President Donald Trump pardoned Arpaio’s conviction for disobeying a 2011 court order to stop his traffic patrols that targeted immigrants.
 
Prosecutor John Keller says the pardon ends the case and that Arpaio will never be held accountable for defying the order.

People, I’m saying this to you solemnly here:
 
Do I have standing to call out Obama (who’s also called Barry Parks) as the Antichrist? 
 
Well, we’re related to the Bernadottes. Indeed, my family’s relatives include a present-day relative (Norwegian ‘Erling Sven Lorentzen’) which is still alive, who’s the second cousin to the English Throne Holder and who’s kids (my distant cousins) are in line of succession (somewhere after the 70s’ ranking in line of succession) to the British Throne. The family also includes many various aristocrats a Royal Count, one of the Norwegian Royal Court Ladies, (called the ‘Mistress of the Robes’) two Norwegian Papal Chamberlains (a count and baron) during the last two centuries.
 
And so Yes, if anyone does, yes I do indeed have that royal standing to be “entitled” (by royal title and standing) to call out the Antichrist of this time, which is Obama. 
 
I’ve gotten endless flak from BIN admins trying to defend Obama against me revealing the truth about Obama and myself…and they’re listening to the wingbats which are counseling them. I think they’re scared of the truth I’m revealing about Obama.
 
Indeed, I’m also revealing among other that Obama’s real name is Barry Parks; he’s the son of Jim T. Parks. 
 
People, investigate that by Googling it.
 
Why is no one recognizing me as Messiah and Jesus’ 2d Coming? Just askin’. It seems strange that that news won’t get out. My being a Buddhist is a plus seeing Jesus himself predicted he’d not return a Christian. Indeed, because all Christians will be corrupted and none will be saved in the end days said Jesus. But “no one knows the day and hour of that news being spread”, not even me, says the Bible, so the truth will hit when it’s ready. My being the Messiah or Jesus isn’t the issue as because of being a Buddhist I have no stakes in being the Christian Messiah. But what counts is that Christians are losing their grasp on the Apocalypse because they’re not rising up to be counted as the chosen ones. They’re not rising to reveal the Antichrist Obama/ and that’s a damning factor for them and a factor that will send them to eternal hell from what the Bible says and if the Bible is to be believed. There are Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse at BIN that have appeared out of nowhere! They all agree with me that Obama’s the Antichrist: they are reporters THE LIGHT, David Montaigne, Mark Brander and Jaywill (aka the “Horseman of Death”).
 
Now to give a short timeline of events leading up to today, let’s look at my youth when I was brought up in the USA and France to a family influenced by Theosophy and schooling such as Rudolf Steiner’s schools. Theosophy’s basic influence is Buddhism from Helena Blavatsky’s Russian background where the influence of Tibetan Buddhism is rife due to the Mongolian Buddhists within the Russian Federation of nations. 
 
My family relative the Royal Count Tolstoy was also a Theosophical spiritualist and corresponded with Gandhi, who also was himself influenced by Buddhism and Theosophy.
 
My wife and I studied Tibetan language and culture at Paris University for five years in the mid-80s..
 
But when still a child, when I reached 15 years old, I was attracted to the religious life and sought to find a master to teach me meditation or yoga.
 
This brought me to Tibetan Buddhism which I practised for many years as a religious Buddhist starting from 1970.
 
In the late 90s, I sought to pass on my knowledge on Internet and particularly my research upon Kalachakra the deity-teachings which announce the Apocalypse within Tibetan Buddhism.
 
My work on Internet suddenly screeched to a halt though when Obama started running for president in early 2007 because I saw on Internet a school registration to Obama’s name stating his faith as Muslim: that was a signal of a red flag to me.
 
Indeed, that set up a red alert signal to me and during the whole of 2007 I dedicated myself solely to fighting against Obama’s election.
 
To achieve that, I sought to find the most powerful anti-Obama video that I could find on You Tube so as to go and find people to share my convictions with.
 
Through that same logic I tried to find all kinds of venues, forums, blogs, videos, articles’ comments on Internet etc…so as to criticise and block Obama but I ended up on the video with most views and most comments that deals with the birther issue: Obama Citizenship: I Invented the Internet (Ep. 6: October Surprise)
 
 
 
Obama Citizenship: I Invented The Internet (Ep. 6: October Surprise)
 
 
 
 
I spent the full time I had left before the election battling pro-Obama forces in the comments there during several heady weeks. I literally littered that video with endless series of comments.
 
 
 
We’ve been legitimized now since that time 9 LONG YEARS AGO by Sheriff joe Arpaio’s press confernce where he said Obama’s birth forgery is the greatest criminal fraud in US history. And it’s thanks to all our efforts that the truth has come out now.
 
 
 
At 0:10: Obama’s birth fraud is diabolical!… the biggest mass fraud in US history.
 
 
 
Zullo: Obama BC Crime/Biggest Criminal Fraud in U.S. History!
 
 
 
 
———–
 
 
 
Then Obama won the election and I went into guerilla mode because things were starting to look bleak for us.
 
 
 
Then = a miracle happened.
 
 
 
Out of the blue, I found an article on Internet by a Newsweek senior editor, Lisa Miller, called “Is Obama the Antichrist?”
 
 
 
That article stated that the day after Obama’s election the lottery in his homestate drew the Mark of the Beast of 666: And everybody knows that’s the Antichrist. 
 
 
 
That fact is ironclad and anyone can go to the Illinois State Lottery website and browse the “Winning Number History Search” at November 5,2008 – Pick 3 and they’ll find that the draw was indeed 666 on that day.
 
Armed with that weapon, I set out to Christian websites to announce to them that Obama was revealed as the Antichrist by a miracle sent from heaven.
 
 
 
I hit a big brick wall with Christians.",0

http://abcnews.go.com/US/tropical-depression-strike-us-gulf-coast-hurricane-weekend/story?id=50286801,Tropical Storm Nate could strike US Gulf Coast as hurricane this weekend,"A newly formed tropical storm in the southwestern Caribbean is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane that could affect the U.S. Gulf Coast.
The system, formerly a tropical depression, strengthened into a tropical storm near the coast of Nicaragua this morning. Tropical Storm Nate was moving across northeastern Nicaragua, churning 50 miles northwest of Puerto Cabezas, as of 2 p.m. ET, according to the National Hurricane Center.
The tropical storm is pounding Nicaragua with rain heavy enough to cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. Up to 30 inches of rain is possible in some areas of Central America through Friday night.
Tropical Storm Nate is expected to be near Cancun, Mexico, by Friday night, according to the National Hurricane Center.
A hurricane watch has already been issued for Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, including Cancun.
ABC News
Nate could reach hurricane status as early as Saturday while entering the Gulf of Mexico. Its trajectory has it on track to make landfall somewhere between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Mobile, Alabama, on Saturday night or Sunday morning as a weak Category 1 hurricane, with winds of about 80 mph. Then, the storm is expected to weaken to a post-tropical system, according to the National Hurricane Center.
But the track and the storm's strength are subject to change.
Residents from Louisiana to Florida are being warned to monitor the system as it approaches this weekend. The area is still feeling the effects of hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
So far, the Atlantic has seen five major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher) during the 2017 season; two short of the record set in 2005, when seven major hurricanes hit.",1

On Oct 1, a new law went into effect that will jail parents if their child is found bullying other minors.
According to WBNG:
Members of the North Tonawanda Common Council hope the new law will put a stop to bullying by holding parents accountable for their children’s actions. Parents could be fined $250 and sentenced to 15 days in jail if twice in a 90-day period their child under 18 violates the city’s curfew or any other city law, including bullying. North Tonawanda officials say the law is geared toward minors who repeatedly bully other children in public places. This law comes after four teens were reportedly kicked out of North Tonawanda Middle School for alleged bullying.
On the surface, the idea of fining and jailing parents for their bully kids may seem like an effective strategy to curtail bullying. However, all it does is open Pandora’s box into horrid nature of the police state and it provides no real solution.
We’ve already seen what happens when police get involved in matters that should not involve them, like childhood quarrels on playgrounds.
Just last week, TFTP reported on a horrifying video that showed a police officer pick up a tiny black child and slam him down face-first onto the concrete for being involved in a scuffle with another student. The presence of police in that situation only made it more dangerous.
Now, with the enactment of this new law, the parents of both of those students in the video mentioned above could also face potentially brutal police action.
Yes, parents are ultimately responsible for the behavior of their younger children. However, politicizing and criminalizing normal, yet often cruel, childhood behavior is not the answer. Also, there is simply no data to support its effectiveness.
We can have all the laws we want holding parents responsible for their children’s actions, writes Anita Kulick from ecparenting.org, but do they really make a difference?
“Very little research has been done to determine the effectiveness of laws that hold parents criminally liable”, says Eve Brank, an associate professor of law and psychology at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. “It’s often just a way for politicians to look hard on juvenile delinquency,” she says.
Often times, fining the parents of a bully could make the situation worse. Bullies, as multiple studies have shown, often have abusive parents who would probably not be too happy if their child happened to get them fined or thrown in prison.
Also, this law assumes that the bully will be correctly identified in the situation. Studies on the subject tell us that the opposite will often happen. School staff often have no idea that a child is being bullied. The same goes for the parents.
It is also important to note that many times, what parents and officials refer to as bullying is not at all seen as bullying by the child.
The real issue, Danah Boyd, who actually studies social interactions online among young people, suggests, is not that “bullying,” is a problem. It’s a lack of empathy. And, of course, that goes way beyond kids. As she notes, “just ask any marital therapist who’s trying to help a couple work through their relationship.” From there, as Tech Dirt notes, she points out that these interactions really aren’t all that different from adult interactions:
FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad) When I look at how teens hurt each other, I can’t help but also see how they’re developing training wheels for future relationships and reflecting normative behaviors that they see around them. I hear teens’ dramas reflected in their stories about how their parents fight — with each other, with their friends and family and colleagues, and with them. What teens are doing is more coarse, more direct, and more explicit. But they’re witnessing adult dramas all around them and what they tend to see isn’t pretty. Parents talking smack about work colleagues or bosses. Parents fighting with each other or ostracizing their family members over disagreements.
While Boyd admits that she doesn’t have the perfect solution to preventing future bullying, looking at the situation through a different lens that isn’t so black and white is a much better start.
All this law does is use the State’s only tools to attempt to solve a problem — revenue collection backed with the threat of violence — ironically, they’re employing one of the tools of bullies.
Instead of simply making something illegal and claiming that it fixes the problem, perhaps it’s time we apply common sense to these scenarios and make it part of everyday life. Instead of teaching children how to be victims and call the police if they think they are being bullied, perhaps — with the right training wheels — we can teach them how to avoid being bullied altogether. Or, we can focus on teaching children empathy, so a bully thinks how they may feel before resorting to their abusive tactics.
As Mike Masnick writes:
There’s a great quote, apparently by Ian Percy that “we judge others by their behavior, while we judge ourselves by our intentions.” It’s really accurate, and highlights the difficulty of having empathy in such situations. People never think that they are in the wrong — and since they can’t readily understand or know the thought process and intentions of others, it often leads to them thinking the worst. If there were better ways to get people to at least recognize that others might also have good intentions, it could at least limit the negative impact of some interactions. Such fights and misunderstandings will never go away. It’s probably wishful thinking to even imagine they can be decreased even slightly. But calling them “cyberbullying” and outlawing jerky behavior or doing silly costumed song-and-dances isn’t going to help matters at all.

","Globalization, migration fears reawaken Germans' interest in 'Heimat'","BERLIN (Reuters) - Most Germans are wary of anything that smacks of nationalism given their Nazi history but the concept of “Heimat” (homeland) is enjoying a renaissance driven by rising anxiety about migration and globalization.
President Frank-Walter Steinmeier used the resonant word 18 times in marking the 27th anniversary of German reunification on Tuesday, saying the nation needed honest dialogue about immigration after taking in over a million migrants since 2015.
Cem Ozdemir, head of the environmental Greens party, applauded Steinmeier for reclaiming the word from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which emphasized nationalist and anti-immigrant themes to capture around 13 percent of the vote in the Sept. 24 national election.
Germany’s post-war history included migration from Italy, Turkey, Greece and eastern Europe, but it has resisted thinking of itself as a country of immigrants. That is changing now amid calls for a proper immigration law to differentiate between political refugees and economic migrants.
Along with that has come new soul-searching about what it means to be German, as well as resurgent demand for dirndls (traditional Alpine dresses), cuckoo clocks, local foods and mystery novels set in regions like the northern island of Sylt.
Raed Saleh, a Berlin politician whose Palestinian parents moved to Germany from the Israeli-occupied West Bank when he was five, said he was reminded of his own identity struggles when he spoke at a high school in Berlin’s Wedding district - where 90 percent of the students come from immigrant families.
“I saw really talented, engaged people and I want them - and all children in Germany - to feel that they belong here,” said Saleh. “I didn’t have that feeling myself for a long time.”
In his book, “German Me: The New Guiding Culture” published earlier this year, Saleh called for a more inclusive “common vision” for Germany and its 82 million people.
His book is one of over a dozen published over the past year that explore German identity and the concept of homeland.
Susanne Weingarten, who oversaw production of a special issue of Der Spiegel magazine dedicated to “Heimat”, said interest by both rightists and liberal young “hipsters” pointed to a certain rootlessness in Germany that had been exacerbated by digitalization, globalization and the migration crisis.

“In Germany, it’s a scorched concept because of National Socialism,” she said, referring to Nazism. “The attempt to define ‘Heimat’ for oneself is difficult. That’s something that only the young generation born 50 to 60 years after the Holocaust can do unselfconsciously.”
Christian Schuele, whose book “Heimat: A Phantom Pain” was published this spring, says the trend and support for far-right parties is driven by a sense of loss of national identity as immigration has surged, especially for those whose towns have shriveled and where local traditions have died out.
The current debate is long overdue, he says, noting the election revealed deep cracks in society caused by the lack of integration of many from the country’s formerly communist east, and others, such as those with backgrounds in Russia and Turkey.
“It’s definitely a topic that moves people,” said Bianca Kroemer, spokeswoman for Berlin’s Dussmann bookstore, which has a whole section focused on the issue.

“‘Heimat’ is in vogue,” agreed Juergen Kron, managing director of the Duesseldorf-based Droste Verlag, whose focus on regional titles had kept sales up despite the overall drop in the publishing market.
National pride became acceptable for the first time since the Nazi era during the summer of 2006, when Germans reveled in their hosting of the soccer World Cup by waving flags long associated only with the far-right.
In recent years, the “buy local” movement has fueled interest in regional books of all kinds, Kron said.
Next week’s Frankfurt Book Fair will feature nearly a dozen events related to the subject of homeland.
Dorothea Suh, a 33-year-old music teacher in Hamburg whose parents came from South Korea two years before her birth, worries that the discussion about German identity comes too late and that other parties will ultimately co-opt the AfD’s agenda.
Stung by recent experiences - including a neighbor yelling “Foreigners out,” Suh is actively planning to emigrate.
“Germany is my home. I don’t want to leave, but I‘m starting to feel like a stranger in my own country,” Suh said. “I don’t want to wait too long and then find myself facing closed doors.”",1

",Britain could join NAFTA if Brexit trade deal fails: Telegraph newspaper,"A pro-EU demonstrator walks past a woman reading a book on the seafront during the Labour party Conference in Brighton, Britain, September 24, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain could join a formal trade alliance with the United States, Canada and Mexico if the European Union refuses to clinch a post-Brexit trade deal, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on Tuesday.
The newspaper said British ministers were looking at joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as part of planning for the possibility of Britain leaving the EU in March 2019 without a trade deal. It gave no sources for the report.
“As we prepare to leave the EU, we will seek to transition all existing EU trade arrangements to ensure that the UK maintains the greatest amount of certainty, continuity and stability in our trade and investment relationships,” a spokesman for the Department for International Trade said.
When asked for comment on The Telegraph report, the spokesman said: “We are confident that we will find a deal that works for Britain and Europe too. But it is our responsibility as a government to prepare for every eventuality, and that is what we are doing.”
Britain is currently negotiating the terms of its divorce from the EU though Prime Minister Theresa May is pushing to move onto discussions about a major free trade deal with the world’s biggest trading bloc.
With the clock ticking down toward Brexit day in 2019, British ministers are exploring the options if the world’s fifth largest economy drops out of the EU without a clear trade deal.
Besides aiming to clinch a U.S. trade deal or forming some new trade grouping, some British supporters of Brexit have pondered joining an existing trade alliance such as NAFTA.
But U.S. President Donald Trump has warned he may terminate the 1994 NAFTA deal because he says it does not serve U.S. economic interests.
If Britain did join NAFTA, manufacturers wanting to export to the EU and North America would have to produce goods in accordance with the two separate sets of rules, according to trade analysts.
Britain, whose regulation has been within the EU’s orbit for over 40 years, would also have to shift toward the North American model for services, goods, competition policy and data protection.
The EU is Britain’s biggest single export market, accounting for about 50 percent of goods exports in August. The United States was the single biggest destination for British exports, accounting for 14 percent in August.",1

",Swiss police to expel two Tunisians linked to Marseille attacker,"PARIS/GENEVA (Reuters) - Switzerland is sending a Tunisian couple who include the brother of a man presumed to have killed two people in a knife attack at a French train station back to their home country for security reasons, Swiss federal police said on Tuesday.
The couple were arrested in the Swiss town of Chiasso near the Swiss-Italian border on Sunday night where they sought asylum. They will detained pending their expulsion, Swiss federal police said, giving no date.
“The man is known to foreign police services for his links with the jihadist terrorist movement. For now his role in the Marseille attack, if any, is not clear,” Swiss federal police said in a statement giving no names or ages for the couple.
Earlier a source close to the investigation said on Tuesday
that Swiss had detained two Tunisians wanted in connection with a deadly knife attack at Marseille train station on Oct. 1.
Swiss police confirmed that one of the two detained is a brother of 29-year-old Ahmed Hannachi, who was shot dead by a French soldier after killing two young women outside the station in southern France.
Authorities are investigating the attack as a “probable” terrorist act.
Hannachi’s younger brother, Anis, was arrested in Italy earlier this month.
More than 240 people have been killed in France since 2015 in attacks by assailants who pledged allegiance to, or said they were inspired by, the Islamic State group.
Earlier this month, the French parliament adopted counter-terrorism legislation to increase police surveillance powers and make it easier to close mosques suspected of preaching hatred - a law which civil rights groups said would infringe on personal freedoms.",1

",Brazil to ramp up oil production before 'renewable era' hits: official,"Brazil's state-run oil company Petrobras LPG fuelling stations are seen in the Guanabara bay in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil October 7, 2017. REUTERS/Pilar Olivares
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil plans to boost oil exploration and production to seize on its reserves before the world enters the “renewable era” and other technologies hurt demand for the fossil fuel, Deputy Energy Minister Paulo Pedrosa told Reuters on Wednesday.
“The stone age did not end for lack of stone, and the oil age will not end for lack of oil,” Pedrosa said in an interview.
“A race has begun to take advantage of the resource, because in the future it might not have value.”
Since 2006, Brazil has discovered potentially massive stores of oil and gas trapped below a layer of salt under the ocean floor off its coast, but slumping global oil prices have complicated efforts to exploit these reserves.
Pedrosa said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which has cut output to reduce a global crude glut and support prices, should not expect Brazil to help control the global oil supply.
OPEC’s chief said Tuesday the cartel was meeting with the United States and reaching out to other countries in an effort to restrict global supplies and combat low prices.
“There was a time when there was concern in the sense that this wealth must be exploited carefully, so that the next generation could take advantage of it,” he said.
“Increasingly, it’s the opposite, we need to accelerate the use of this wealth.”
Pedrosa said he was not aware of any OPEC contact with Brazil regarding efforts to cut oil supply.
State-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA, which accounts for 94 percent of Brazilian oil production, is now a market-driven company and it does not make business sense for it to reduce supplies, nor is it in the country’s interests to force the oil company to do it, Pedrosa said.
Brazil has several rounds of bidding for new exploration areas planned each year through 2019 and is discussing two additional annual auctions in both 2020 and 2021.",1
http://www.disclose.tv/news/north_korea_threatens_with_hydrogen_bomb_explosion_over_the_pacific/140353,North Korea threatens with hydrogen bomb explosion over the Pacific Ocean,"The dispute between the USA and North Korea is getting more heated!
 
On Tuesday, President Donald Trump (71) had threatened dictator Kim Jong-un (33) with ""total annihilation"" of his country in his speech to the UN General Assembly. On Thursday, he tightened the US sanctions against North Korea.
 
Now Kim beats back against Trump - and mocks him! I will tame the mentally ill, senile American with fire "", the dictator told the official news agency KCNA on Friday.
 
Trump's remarks are what Kim calls ""the most fierce declaration of war in history"".
 
Trump's threats did not intimidate him, however, nor did they stop him, emphasized North Korea's rulers. He is much more convinced that he has chosen the right path and that he must follow this path to the end.
 
Kim is considering hydrogen bomb test over the Pacific
 
Trump will pay dearly for his speech to the United Nations. Now that the US president has insulted him and his country in front of the world, North Korea is seriously considering ""taking a tough countermeasure at the highest level in history"".
 
Kim did not say what concrete steps he was considering. His foreign minister Ri Yong Ho, on the other hand, has already gone into more detail...
 
In his opinion, Kim Jong-un is considering testing a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean.
 
As the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported on Friday, Ri Yong Ho said in New York that he believes his country could consider such a test on an unprecedented scale.
 
Ri said so when asked what Kim meant when he spoke of ""tough countermeasures"" after US President Donald Trump threatened him. He doesn't know exactly what Kim is up to.

",U.N. denies India singled out over slavery estimates,"NEW DELHI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The United Nations on Friday defended its new global estimates on slavery after local media reported that India’s intelligence agency advised Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discredit the research, saying it may tarnish the country’s image and exports.
A report by International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Australian rights group Walk Free Foundation published on Sept. 19 found more than 40 million people across the world were victims of modern day slavery last year.
The report said 62 percent of those in forced marriages or forced labor such as construction or domestic work were in the Asia-Pacific region. It did not provide country-specific data.
But in a memo from India’s Intelligence Bureau to Modi’s office, the agency questioned the report’s methodology, claiming the data “has enough potential to substantially harm India’s image and exports,” the Indian Express reported on Wednesday.
The bureau warned that “global documentation on slavery is increasingly targeting India as home to the highest number of slaves in the world,” and called for a strong campaign to “discredit” the information, the newspaper report added.
A home ministry official said that he could not confirm or deny inputs from security agencies.
ILO officials rejected claims India was being targeted and said they had full confidence in the report’s findings.
“The memo is based on a misunderstanding. There are no national figures in the data. We don’t single out any country,” Beate Andrees, ILO’s chief of the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
“We collaborated with Walk Free for a global figure as there was there was a strong demand among practitioners who found it unhelpful to have competing numbers on this.”
“QUESTIONABLE STATISTICS”
According to the Indian Express, the memo cited figures from a 2016 report by the Walk Free Foundation which estimated that 40 percent - over 18 million - of the world’s estimated 45.8 million slaves were in India.
The ILO’s senior statistician, Michaelle De Cock, said the security agency had confused data from last year’s Walk Free Foundation with this year’s new global estimates.
“There has been some confusion over the data. We do not endorse the data from the Walk Free report last year. Our global estimates are based on a completely new methodology which has to go through all the usual ILO procedures.”
There are no national figures on the number of people in slavery in India, but the labor ministry recently announced plans to identify, rescue and help over 18 million bonded laborers by 2030.
In India, many victims are villagers lured by traffickers with the promise of a good job and an advance payment, only to find themselves forced to toil in fields or brick kilns, enslaved in brothels or confined as maids to pay off debt.
Others work at the bottom of complex and often untransparent supply chains - producing everything from jewelry, cosmetics and garments - where they work long hours under strenuous condition for a meager wage and with little freedoms.
According to the newspaper report, the intelligence agency said the data from the ILO-Walk Free Foundation report was based on “questionable statistics” with interviews with over 17,000 people in India, but only 2,000 or less in other countries.
But Walk Free Foundation’s head of global research, Fiona David, said the global estimates were drawn from the best data available on modern slavery today.
“We welcome the Indian government’s continued focus and commitment on this issue,” said David. “We would be delighted to work with the Indian government on national estimation efforts.”
Campaigners say the leaked memo may be part of a wider policy by the Indian government to crack down on civil society groups which voice dissent or attempt to show India in a poor light.
In 2014, the security agency questioned the motives of foreign-funded charities such as Greenpeace claiming that their campaigns against mining, genetically modified crops and nuclear power was harming India’s development.

",Microscope trailblazers win chemistry Nobel for 'freeze framing' life,"STOCKHOLM/LONDON (Reuters) - A trio of Swiss, American and British scientists won the 2017 Nobel chemistry prize on Wednesday for developing cryo-electron microscopy, allowing researchers to see biological molecules frozen in action.
The work by Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson makes it possible to image proteins and other molecules after freezing them rapidly to preserve their shape, providing a powerful new tool for medical research.
“It’s like frames in a movie. Each of these pictures represents a frame and they can be put together into a movie and we can see what the molecules do,” said Peter Brzezinski, a member of the Nobel committee for chemistry.
The new approach fills a previously blank space by generating images of everything from the surface of the Zika virus to proteins that cause antibiotic resistance or are involved in Alzheimer‘s.
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awarded the 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize, said the technology had moved biochemistry into a new era.
By freezing biomolecules mid-movement, scientists can unravel previously unseen processes - a major advance both for basic understanding and the potential development of new drugs.
Scottish-born scientist Henderson used an electron microscope to generate a three-dimensional image of a protein at an atomic resolution, showing the potential of the technology.
Until then, electron microscopes were only seen as suitable for imaging dead matter, because the powerful electron beam destroyed the biological material.
His breakthrough was further developed by German-born scientist Frank, a U.S. citizen, while Dubochet of Switzerland used rapidly frozen water to preserve the natural shape of the biomolecules.
Frank said cryo-electron microscopy had “immense” potential for medical research, which is increasingly focused on processes inside cells, but it would take time for this to play out - and he was taken aback by news of the award.
“I was overwhelmed. I thought the chances of winning a Nobel prize were miniscule,” he told a news briefing by telephone.
MAPPING DISEASE
Henderson was equally taken aback and said he had rejected the first phone call from the Swedish academy on Wednesday before picking up second time.

“The three of us who have been awarded the prize are sort of acting on behalf of the whole field,” he told a news conference in Cambridge, England.
Understanding the structure of proteins and working out how they interact in the body should spark fresh approaches to drug development, just as earlier advances had produced today’s multibillion-dollar biotech drugs, he added.
“In a few years, maybe five years, we might know most of the structures ... it’s quite an exciting time,” Henderson said.
Indeed, cryo-electron microscopy is already delivering results, such as the recent discovery of the structure of tau protein filaments in Alzheimer’s disease.

It was also put to work last year in the fight against Zika, when the mosquito-borne virus was linked to an epidemic of brain-damaged babies in Brazil.
As alarm about the outbreak spread, scientists were able to generate three-dimensional images of Zika at the atomic level, jump-starting the search for potential drugs and vaccines.
“The use of these methods has completely revolutionized structural biology so everyone now wants to buy this type of equipment and start this type of research, all over the world,” Johan Aqvist, another Nobel committee member, told Reuters.
U.S.-based Thermo Fisher Scientific is a leading supplier of cryo-electron microscopy instruments.
Chemistry is the third of this year’s Nobel Prizes after the winners of the medicine and physics prizes were announced earlier this week.
The prizes are named after Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, and have been awarded since 1901 for achievements in science, literature and peace, in accordance with his will.
While the chemistry award has sometimes been overshadowed by the towering reputations of physics winners such as Albert Einstein, laureates include ground-breaking scientists such as radioactivity pioneers Ernest Rutherford and Marie Curie, though she also won the physics prize.
The award passed over one of the highest-profile fields of research, the so-called CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology that earlier this year allowed U.S. scientists to alter genes in a human embryo to correct a disease-causing mutation.

",'Loving Vincent' brings Van Gogh's art alive,"(Reuters) - You have seen his “Sunflowers” in a museum, sung along with Don McLean to “Vincent (Starry Starry Night)” and gawped at the tens of million of dollars his works have fetched at auction.
But you have never seen Vincent Van Gogh’s art quite like it is shown in the film “Loving Vincent.”
Seven years in the making and billed as the world’s first fully-painted feature film, “Loving Vincent” uses more than 130 of the Dutch artist’s own paintings to tell his own story.
Each of the 65,000 frames of the animated independent film, created by Polish artist and animator Dorota Kobiela, is an oil painting hand painted by 125 professional artists who traveled from around the world to be a part of the project.
“It looks like something completely different, and that doesn’t happen very often in our media-saturated world,” said Hugh Welchman, who co-wrote and directed the film with Kobiela.
“Loving Vincent,” showing in limited release in New York and Los Angeles and arriving in Europe in October, was first filmed with actors playing some of the people Van Gogh captured on canvas.
They include Saiorse Ronan as doctor’s daughter Marguerite Gachet and Chris O‘Dowd as postman Joseph Roulin, who walk through and inhabit his paintings as his story unfolds.
Then came the hard part. Finding and training the painters to reproduce Van Gogh’s work.

More than 4,000 artists from around the world applied for the job and 125 were chosen and put through three weeks training.
“Even though we were hiring the very best oil painters, Vincent’s style look like it should be very easy but actually it’s difficult to do well,” said Welchman.
“Even after training there were still quite a few painters who really found it impossible to get to grips with his style,” Welchman said.
The $5.5 million production focuses on the last weeks of Van Gogh’s life before his death in 1890 in France at age 37 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Welchman said the film has triggered some unusual responses.
“We’ve had a lot of people in tears at screenings. People are sending poems or making cakes with intricate Vincent paintings on the cake,” he said.
He and Kobiela hope the film encourages audiences to discover more about Van Gogh.
“I’d like them to think there is more to his story than he went mad, cut off his ears, was a genius and did these incredibly colorful paintings that sell for lots of money.”",1

","A Veteran Asks, ""What’s Worse, a Kneeling Millionaire or 300,000 Vets Neglected to Death?""","By Matt Agorist
Naturally, Americans are up in arms because a bunch of folks who get paid millions of dollars to throw around a leather ball decided to kneel during the national anthem. I find this ironic for several reasons.
First off, I’d like to clarify that choosing not to watch football because someone did something you disagree with is entirely your choice and your choice alone. Just like NFL players can make the decision to kneel during the anthem, you can make the decision to change the channel. It’s called freedom, it is awesome, and I highly recommend it.
That being said, I’d like to draw attention to two points, one being the idea of a country whose leader shames others and calls for the termination of their employment for practicing their right to disagree with the government, and two, why are people so upset over a bunch of kneeling millionaires?
Donald Trump was well within his right to say whatever he wants about the NFL players, up to and including calling for the NFL to fire them. It’s called freedom, and you don’t have to like it to participate in it. But, if Trump really wanted the players to start standing up for the anthem, calling for them to be fired is not only on the verge of tyrannical, but it’s nowhere close to a solution.
Respect is earned. It is not mandated through threats or abuse of power or forced through the barrel of a gun. If there was one thing I learned in the Marine Corps it’s that good leaders are ones that lead by example. Those leaders who demanded respect without first earning it were the reason for me turning down a 5-figure tax-free reenlistment bonus to stay in.
Leaders, and I use that term loosely, who want something from you and don’t have the common decency or fortitude to first apply themselves and find a peaceful and mutually beneficial way to get it are not leading by example and deserve no respect. Sadly, in America, leaders haven’t done these things in a long time. In America, through propaganda and fear, our leaders are demanding and mandating respect—without earning it. This is the definition of tyranny.
If Donald Trump really wanted the football players to start standing during the national anthem, then he should ask them what it is they want. If the dozens of millionaires taking knees can’t articulate a rational and well thought out list of requests, then they are merely publicity hounds buying into the divide. Colin Kaepernick could do this, and he’s has taken action to try to resolve his grievances.
I’m not quite sure all these other NFL players would be such good leaders—like Kaepernick—if asked what it is they want.
If it’s police brutality they are protesting, where were most of these folks when Obama was in office? It’s not like police brutality and racist policing practices suddenly became an issue once Trump took over in 2017. Where were all these NFL players when Obama was filling prisons with black people for possessing a plant? Where were all these NFL players when Obama continued to wage the drug war which is proven to lay far more waste to the rights of those with darker skin than to those with lighter skin? Outside of just a few of them, they were nowhere to be found, that’s where.
That brings me to my second point—the folks who are angry at these football players taking knees—because it disrespects our country, our troops and our veterans. Again, these folks have every right to voice their opinion, be angry, and boycott the NFL. It’s called freedom, and it’s awesome, and I highly recommend it.
That being said, if a person taking a knee during a song is disrespectful to our troops and veterans, what, exactly, is it considered when 307,000 of those veterans die waiting for care they were promised by this country? If a person taking a knee during a song is disrespectful to those who fought for our country, what is it considered when that country looks the other way when there over 40,000 of those veterans living on the streets with no home? If taking a knee at a football game is disrespectful, what then, is it considered when Americans remain silent as a veteran kills himself or herself every 65 minutes, every single day, every single month, of every single year?
If this song and flag represent the land of the free and people kneeling down makes others angry because it is an insult to that freedom, then how does one view the NSA surveillance grid? Is a person taking a knee worse than the United States of America creating the largest spying network the world has ever seen—one that the Stasi would’ve killed for—and using it on innocent Americans?
Is a person kneeling more offensive than the TSA groping babies, cancer patients, the elderly, and the disabled, despite never stopping a terror attack? Is a knee more offensive to freedom than the United States creating, maintaining, and financing the largest prison population the world has ever seen through the enforcement of victimless crimes?
Is a rich football player kneeling really that much more offensive than the Commander in Chief making one of the largest weapons deals in the history of the US with the largest state sponsor of terror in the world, Saudi Arabia? Is a knee more offensive than calling Saudi Arabia our ally after they were exposed for financing the horrific attacks on 9/11?
Where is the outrage? Call me a traitor, call me unpatriotic, call me whatever you want, tell me to move to Somalia and eat shit and die, because—freedom baby. However, I’ll always stand against tyranny, even if that means pissing people off for telling the truth. In an empire of lies, telling the truth is a revolutionary and often hated act.
If we can agree on one thing in this sea of vitriol and disagreement, let us remember that this country was born through protest. Slavery ended because of protest. The Declaration of Independence was a protest. It was not order-following and blind compliance that created America—it was disobedience.

",The dying art of the great song intro,"Image caption Clean Bandit have squeezed the intros in their hits
Great song intros, where a tune builds up before the vocal kicks in, are becoming an endangered species as fickle music fans skip tracks if they don't get immediate gratification.
That's the view of the man who co-produced two Clean Bandit number ones this year, and it's backed up by stats.
The average intro time has dropped from more than 20 seconds to five seconds since the mid-1980s, research has found.
Producer Mark Ralph said it is because the rise of streaming services means it's now much easier to move on to the next song if you're not instantly hooked.
Spotify vs vinyl
""Attention spans have now decreased and that is potentially down to the ease with which you can chop and change between pieces of music if you're bored,"" he told BBC News.
""If you imagine trying to do that with one piece of vinyl, if you get bored in the first 10 seconds, to take it off the turntable, find another record, put it on and start again is quite a long-winded process.
""Nowadays, if you're sitting on Spotify and get bored within 10 seconds, you just flick a button and you're on to the next thing. I think you have to grab peoples' attention much more quickly.""
Image caption Sam Smith's voice arrives almost immediately in Too Good At Goodbyes
Ralph worked on Clean Bandit's smash Rockabye, in which Sean Paul's vocal began after just a second; and Symphony, a number one in April, in which the vocal appeared after a whole seven seconds.
Three of this year's other UK number ones have had intros that lasted just a second or two before the vocals kicked in - DJ Khaled and Rihanna's Wild Thoughts; Artists for Grenfell's charity version of Bridge Over Troubled Water; and the current chart-topper, Sam Smith's Too Good At Goodbyes.
Feels, the mega-hit created by Calvin Harris, Pharrell Williams, Katy Perry and Big Sean, goes for 30 seconds before the main vocal arrives - but even that intro is punctuated by cries of ""hey!"", ""oh yeah!"" and ""ha!"".
In research published earlier this year, Ohio State University doctoral student Hubert Leveille Gauvin found that intro lengths had dropped by 78% between 1986 and 2015.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Katy Perry can't keep quiet during the Feels intro
""That's insane, but it makes sense,"" Gauvin said. ""The voice is one of the most attention-grabbing things there is in music.
""It's survival of the fittest - songs that manage to grab and sustain listeners' attention get played and others get skipped. There's always another song.
""If people can skip so easily and at no cost, you have to do something to grab their attention.""
There's another reason musicians want to grab fans' attention. If a tune is played for less than 30 seconds on Spotify, it doesn't count as a play and they don't get paid.
Those are factors that songwriters and producers are aware of when crafting their future hits, Mark Ralph says.
""I think they're talking about it a lot because obviously it's in their interests to be as successful as they possibly can, and they want to have their tracks streamed as many times and played on the radio as many times as they can.""

http://dailybuzzlive.com/video-released-elderly-german-captive-beheaded-islamic-state/,Video Released of Elderly German Captive Beheaded by Islamic State,"The Philippines and Germany condemned on Monday the beheading of an elderly German captive by Islamic State-linked Abu Sayyaf militants who posted a video of the killing after a deadline for a US$600,000 ransom passed.
 
The video showed a machete-wielding militant behead Jurgen Kantner. The German had appealed for help twice in short video messages, saying he would be killed if ransom were not paid.
 
Jesus Dureza, presidential adviser on the Philippine peace process, said officials had exhausted all efforts to save Kantner, 70, who was held on the tiny southern island of Jolo.
 
“We grieve as we strongly condemn the barbaric beheading of yet another kidnap victim,” Dureza said in a statement. “There must be a stop to this killing of the innocent and the helpless.”
 
He made no mention of the ransom demand.
 
 
The Philippines’ armed forces pledged in a separate statement to bring Kantner’s killers to justice and to continue operations to free other hostages held by Abu Sayyaf.
 
In Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a united international front against terrorism.
 
“The chancellor condemns this hideous attack that shows, once again, how unprincipled and barbarous terrorists act,” her spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement. “We’ve all got to stand together in the fight against terrorists.”
 
Last year Abu Sayyaf decapitated two Canadians on Jolo but later freed their two companions, a Filipino woman and a Norwegian. The four had been seized from a tourist resort. The ransom demand for the Canadians was 6.4 million U.S. dollars each.
 
Abu Sayyaf’s activities in recent years have been mainly banditry, but the Philippines believes Islamic State has been in contact with members of the group’s leadership with a view to gaining a foothold in Southeast Asia.
 
YACHT SEIZED
 
Abu Sayyaf, which means “bearer of the sword”, has capitalised on decades of instability in the southern Philippines and generated tens of millions of dollars from piracy and ransom payments.
 
It uses the money to buy arms, high-powered boats and modern navigation equipment, allowing it to avoid detection and seize crew of slow-moving vessels with ease.
 
Kantner and his companion were taken captive in November while sailing on a 53-footer yacht near Sabah, eastern Malaysia, and brought to Jolo. His companion was shot dead when she tried to resist the militants.
 
Reports of Kantner’s execution emerged on Sunday evening, but the military only confirmed the killing on Monday, citing “reliable sources”. It said it would continue to search for Kantner’s remains in order to hand them over to his family.
 
Abu Sayyaf is currently holding 26 hostages – 13 Vietnamese, seven Filipinos, a Dutch national, a Japanese, two Indonesians and two Malaysians, the military says. Experts say the group is very unlikely to free any hostages without payment.
 
Speaking on the sidelines of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Philippines Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay said Manila was seeking technological help from allies to pinpoint the hostages’ location.
 
The Philippines has deployed thousands of troops in the Abu Sayyaf strongholds of Basilan, Tawi-Tawi and Jolo islands, yet despite air and ground offensives, the group’s piracy and kidnappings continue unabated.
 
The rebels are entrenched in local communities, complicating operations by a military that is wary of incurring civilian casualties.

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
http://robertsiciliano.com/
Are you making a big home security mistake? If you are leaving your doors unlocked, or if you are using low quality lock systems, you are putting yourself…and your home…at risk.
However, just because your door is locked, it doesn’t mean that a burglar can’t kick the door down. But, having the door locked can make it more difficult. This is only one secret that your local locksmith won’t tell you, but there are several more. Here are a few:
Securing Your Doors
Reinforce the door frame around the hinge and lock. Consider door reinforcement kits, such as Door Devil.
Install a peephole.
Don’t answer the door unless you are expecting a visitor. Tell the same to your kids.
Install hardened steel deadbolts. These are highly encouraged. Make sure they have a five-pin tumbler, too.
Consider multi-lock deadbolts or vertical deadbolts.
Accessories for Your Door to Make it More Secure
Consider a door brace. These will help to prevent a burglar from opening the door.
A wedge or door stop will likely not totally stop a burglar, but if you choose one with an alarm, anyone in the home will definitely hear it.
A door chain will not protect you. It doesn’t take a lot of pressure to break them.
Additional Tips for Door Security
Replace your hollow wood door with a metal or solid wood door.
Choose a door that does NOT have a window. An intruder can easily break a window and access the lock.
If you have a current door that DOES have a window, install attractive metal bars over the glass.
Make sure the hinges of the door are not visible on the outside of the door.
Consider installing a cross bar. This is a heavy steel bar that you can place across the inside of the door.
Inspect deadbolts. Any deadbolt that is low quality should be replaced. If you want to have even more security, install a second deadbolt.
Use door braces when you can. Take one of these braces and stick it under the knob of the door. The other end will remain on the floor at an angle to the doorknob. These are great devices, but too many people forget to put the brace up before they go to bed or leave the home. It is useless if it is just leaning against the wall, and it only takes a couple of seconds to put into place.
For the best door security, think about installing some type of door reinforcement kit. Imagine how secure your door would be with 1/16-inch of heavy steel. No one could kick through that! Also, imagine a four-foot metal bar that you install right over the strike plates and screw directly into the frame of the door. This will give you one tough security system on your door, and it’s exactly what the door jamb security kit from Door Devil offers. See here on YouTube.

",World Cup 2018: Have England improved since the 2014 World Cup?,"England qualified for the World Cup with victory over Slovenia last week
England manager Gareth Southgate painted a brutally honest picture of his current squad - and arguably their chances at next summer's World Cup - when he cast doubt on whether he possessed ""big players"".
Southgate has secured qualification for Russia but England's progress has been unspectacular and they will not travel accompanied by great expectations.
England's last brush with tournament football was that harrowing night in Nice in June last year when they lost 2-1 to Iceland in the last 16 of Euro 2016 and manager Roy Hodgson effectively resigned on the spot.
Project goalkeeper & playmaker The pre-World Cup challenges facing Southgate
It followed a dismal World Cup in Brazil in 2014, when England did not make it out of the group stage following defeats by Italy and Uruguay and were reduced to the embarrassment of playing out a dead rubber against Costa Rica in their final game.
So, with Southgate putting his squad's quality into context, and looking back at previous selections, are England in any better shape to make an impact in Russia than they were in Brazil and France?
Goalkeepers
England took Fraser Forster, Ben Foster and Joe Hart to the 2014 World Cup and Tom Heaton, Forster and Hart to Euro 2016
England's goalkeepers at the past two tournaments World Cup 2014 Euro 2016 Fraser Forster (Celtic) Tom Heaton (Burnley) Ben Foster (West Brom) Fraser Forster (Southampton) Joe Hart (Manchester City) Joe Hart (Manchester City)
England's goalkeepers for the 2018 World Cup almost pick themselves - and it is a stronger hand than Hodgson had to play with in the past two major tournaments.
Southgate appears to have settled on Joe Hart as his first choice but the memories of his edgy, hyped-up displays in the 2014 World Cup and his crucial errors for goals conceded against Wales and Iceland at Euro 2016 mean this is a debate that will continue.
England are in a better place to deal with this problem now because back-up and competition is better than it has been for years with 24-year-old Jack Butland excelling at Stoke City and Jordan Pickford, 23, shining after his £30m move to Everton.
Hart needs to maintain his form to fight off this pair, with Burnley's Tom Heaton also in the shake-up for a squad place, but he will be under the microscope once the World Cup starts to see how he copes with the pressure.
Verdict: England's overall quality is stronger but Southgate looks set to keep faith with a keeper whose flaws were exposed in Brazil and France. Will it prove a mistake?
Defenders
Gary Cahill and Chris Smalling are the only two defenders to have been in both of England's past two major tournament squads
England's defenders at the past two tournaments World Cup 2014 Euro 2016 Leighton Baines (Everton) Ryan Bertrand (Southampton) Gary Cahill (Chelsea) Gary Cahill (Chelsea) Phil Jagielka (Everton) Nathaniel Clyne (Liverpool) Glen Johnson (Liverpool) Danny Rose (Tottenham) Phil Jones (Manchester United) Chris Smalling (Manchester United) Luke Shaw (Southampton) John Stones (Everton) Chris Smalling (Manchester United) Kyle Walker (Tottenham)
England's options in the defensive areas for next year look stronger than they did in previous tournaments - but that does not mean Southgate's backline will give off an air of confidence.
The full-backs are almost interchangeable with Kyle Walker established at right-back and Ryan Bertrand now the regular left-back. Liverpool's Nathaniel Clyne and Danny Rose at Tottenham provide similar alternatives but are struggling with injury.
A back four of Leighton Baines, Gary Cahill, Phil Jagielka and Glen Johnson was ageing and cruelly exposed in Brazil and Southgate will surely be casting eyes in the direction of Manchester in the hope a solid central-defensive partnership emerges.
John Stones and Gary Cahill played together in the recent qualifier against Slovenia at Wembley
Phil Jones' career had threatened to stall after early comparisons with Duncan Edwards but he has flourished under Jose Mourinho at Manchester United. John Stones, who also suffered a dip after his £47.5m move from Everton to Manchester City, is again starting to look like the defender who was once regarded as the future but then disappeared almost undetected from the England team.
Jones and Stones, at their best and if their renaissance continues, offer a good blend in central defence and an upgrade on the Cahill/Chris Smalling partnership in France - but Southgate may still want the Chelsea's captain's experience, even though he has struggled at major tournaments.
He will probably want his pairing to come from those three, with Smalling still in contention, because the likes of Leicester City's Harry Maguire and Everton's Michael Keane offer promise, but will have nothing in the way of experience at the sharp end of a major tournament when the action starts in Russia.
Southgate opened up another possibility by using a three-man defensive system in Sunday's final qualifier in Lithuania.
England have high-profile friendlies coming up against Germany and Brazil and they would appear to be the perfect opportunity to test out his preferred players in that system against high-class opposition.
England's defensive candidates in the Premier League since August 2016 Games Tackles Blocks Interceptions Clearances Pass accuracy % Ryan Bertrand 35 44 15 52 53 83.61 Gary Cahill 41 55 18 48 179 88.06 Nathaniel Clyne 37 80 2 43 54 83.34 Phil Jones 25 43 18 41 179 90.57 Michael Keane 41 38 50 75 302 74.68 Harry Maguire 36 64 34 76 180 76.70 Danny Rose 18 50 3 22 52 77.27 Chris Smalling 20 12 9 16 133 88.56 John Stones 34 33 14 46 129 92.88 Kyle Walker 39 77 6 42 109 81.68
Chris Waddle, who reached a World Cup semi-final with England in 1990, has concerns.
""Central defence has been a problem for a long time now since people like Rio Ferdinand left the scene,"" he said. ""I don't think we've really had an outstanding partnership since the Terry-Ferdinand years.
""I think age is creeping up on some and do the younger ones like Keane and Maguire have the experience to go into a major tournament against the likes of Brazil, Argentina, Germany and Spain? I'm not so sure.""
Verdict: If Jones and Stones are at their best they will be a nice contrast and give England a more solid appearance in central defence - it is still a big ""if"" at this stage of the season.
Walker and Bertrand or Rose will be the full-back partnership, positions England were found short in at the past two tournaments.
Southgate may just have a better defence than Hodgson had in Brazil and France but it still has a vulnerable look and you would not stake your life on its reliability under pressure.
Midfielders
Ross Barkley, Jordan Henderson, Adam Lallana, James Milner and Jack Wilshere made the squad in 2014 and 2016
England's midfielders at the past two tournaments World Cup 2014 Euro 2016 Ross Barkley (Everton) Dele Alli (Tottenham) Steven Gerrard (Liverpool) Ross Barkley (Everton) Jordan Henderson (Liverpool) Eric Dier (Tottenham) Adam Lallana (Southampton) Jordan Henderson (Liverpool) Frank Lampard (Chelsea) Adam Lallana (Liverpool) James Milner (Manchester City) James Milner (Liverpool) Jack Wilshere (Arsenal) Jack Wilshere (Arsenal)
Here is where Southgate might have to pull off his biggest balancing act of all.
The central pairing of Jordan Henderson and a Steven Gerrard at the end of his England career failed in Brazil, while Liverpool's current captain and Eric Dier were colourless and lacking impact in France. Their shortage of creativity and 'much of a muchness' combination must be addressed or Southgate risks faring no better than Hodgson in tournament combat.
The increasing desperation to find a cure has seen eyes cast towards Ross Barkley, injured and an outcast at Everton, in the hope he might find form with a move to Spurs in January and a quick-fix partnership with Dier that could work for club and country.
This is the same Barkley that Hodgson would not touch with a bargepole in France. Even Jack Wilshere's name has appeared in the debate after resurfacing at Arsenal.
Former England international Waddle suggested Chelsea new boy Danny Drinkwater and Newcastle United maverick Jonjo Shelvey as possibilities and the stakes are high. If Southgate can find the answer England could make real progress on what was on offer in Brazil and France.
Chris Waddle's England starting XI at the 2018 World Cup
A creative player could serve Dele Alli in his telepathic link with Spurs team-mate Harry Kane, and Adam Lallana - England's best player before his injury, according to Southgate - will be another important addition in the midfield area once he is fit and playing for Liverpool.
There are young possibilities such as Everton teenager Tom Davies, Spurs rookie Harry Winks and Nathaniel Chalobah at Watford but it would require serious progress and serious trust from Southgate.
It could end up being a mix-and-match three-man midfield of Dier centrally, with Lallana and Henderson either side, Alli at 10 and a threatening strikeforce of Kane and Manchester United's Marcus Rashford.
Verdict: Southgate will hope for a late wildcard, perhaps Barkley, to stake a claim otherwise England's stodgy central midfield will lack imagination and offer little improvement on 2014 in Brazil, and France last summer.
Forwards
Harry Kane (bottom left) is certain to lead the line for England in Russia
England's forwards at the past two tournaments World Cup 2014 Euro 2016 Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal) Harry Kane (Tottenham) Rickie Lambert (Southampton) Marcus Rashford (Manchester United) Wayne Rooney (Manchester United) Wayne Rooney (Manchester United) Raheem Sterling (Liverpool) Raheem Sterling (Manchester City) Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool) Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool) Danny Welbeck (Manchester United) Jamie Vardy (Leicester)
England will definitely pose more danger in attack than in France, when Kane looked exhausted and Wayne Rooney's England career was drawing to a disappointing conclusion.
Kane is rejuvenated, full of confidence and is now a match-winner on the brink of world-class.
Rashford will have another 12 months of experience and know-how to make even more use of his fearlessness and blistering pace that will force any defence in world football to take a few steps back.
If one, or indeed both, come off in Russia - with Alli in support - England will carry real danger if they can get the supply right.
Phil Neville's England starting XI at the 2018 World Cup
Former England international Phil Neville told BBC Sport: ""We know the qualifying rounds are not really a barometer and friendlies are exactly that. Until we go to a major tournament it is difficult to say England are going to do this or that.
""We have got quality. This team are better for experiences in France.
""I see this as a fantastically talented England team who have got every chance of doing well in a tournament but until they get there and see how they react under pressure we will never know.""
England were short of punch in Brazil and France. Kane and Rashford can provide the knockout blows with the pace of Leicester City's Jamie Vardy a weapon off the bench.
Verdict: If it all comes together and Kane and Rashford stay fit, this is an area of real progress and promise for Southgate and England.
Manager
Gareth Southgate took over from Roy Hodgson's successor, Sam Allardyce, who left the England job after one game
Hodgson actually looked at his best at Euro 2012, weeks into the England job and concentrating on what he did and does best. Organisation. Organisation. Organisation.
In Brazil and France it looked like Hodgson was too keen to get ""with it"" to prove critics who questioned his pragmatic style wrong, tinkering with attacking formations in a manner that was out of character, with inevitably disappointing results.
Southgate, new to the job and this elite level of international football, will be learning as he goes but the 2018 World Cup will be no free hit - he will need to produce acceptable results.
England's World Cup wins 2014: None 2010: Slovenia (1-0) 2006: Paraguay (1-0), Trinidad & Tobago (2-0), Ecuador (1-0) 2002: Argentina (1-0), Denmark (3-0) 1998: Tunisia (2-0), Colombia (2-0)
Former England captain Terry Butcher is an admirer, saying: ""I have seen him change systems and personnel. The Wayne Rooney situation, when he left his captain and major personality out, is an example where he showed he had a tough mentality and a tough character.
""Sometimes people see a calmness and gentleness about him but you shouldn't mistake that for timidity and being afraid. He has got a lot of steel there.
""Gareth would not have had the career he had as a player without real steel and character. He was captain everywhere he played, and he would not be England manager without being ruthless.
""He has shown he can be ruthless and flexible. I have got no worries about Gareth and I am quite looking forward to him going into the World Cup as England manager.""
Southgate is a calm-headed realist who accepts some recent England displays have been disappointing. They have made heavy weather of a comfortable group and will strike no fear into opponents in Russia.
Southgate has a matter of months to put that right.
Verdict: Southgate will find it hard to do any worse than Hodgson did in Brazil and France but whether he is the upgrade England required will only be measured by events next summer.
England have improved goalkeeping alternatives - but will Southgate use them? - and an attack that looks potent as the preparations ramp up. Midfield, however, is a serious headache.
Friendlies against Germany and Brazil will sharpen some of the blurred lines around England's squad and their World Cup aspirations but Southgate believes he has a blend of youth and experience to prove they are a better bet in Russia than they have been at recent showpiece events.",1

",Hey Mr. Girardi... Respect,"Sit down. Buckle up. Take a deep breath. JOE GIRARDI is a better manager than JOE TORRE.
Photo: Getty Images
Here… let me “All Caps” it for the people with iffy eyesight…JOE GIRARDI IS A BETTER MANAGER THAN JOE TORRE. Now, just like when Joba snapped at Mariano I’m sure a good deal of you feel like I just insulted the Pope. I didn’t. This is an opinion. It’s my opinion, and it’s one that I feel very strongly about.
I’m a Joe Girardi fan (Please note I love Mr. T as well and think the world of him as a person.) and I believe GI Joe is the better Skipper. No, he is not good with the media. No, he isn’t flashy. Nope, he ain’t even a born, bred New Yorker…ya know what? He is an OUTSTANDING manager and a big reason the Yankees are where they are.
Joe Torre was a genius at keeping talented, high priced, inflated egos in check, but he was always getting those type of players. He had the Core 4 in their prime. He saw the best Bronx Bomber team since Murder’s Row win…and win and win and win. How’d he do before King George hired him to replace Buck? (Who, like him or not, did a lot of heavy lifting to build the Yankees.) How’d he do when he went “Hollywood”? Joe was great for the Yankees…but he isn’t the manager Girardi is. If you are letting go the pinstriped blinders for a minute and being honest with yourself I think you may see what I’m saying.
Photo: Getty Images
Yankee fans have a way of taking the glory years and making them seem untouchable. Joe Torre was good, Joe Girardi is better. He backs up his guys. He KNOWS the game (You can take a walk with all the Binder nonsense). Joe is a brilliant guy. You don’t graduate from Northwestern with an Engineering degree because you had a library card and a pulse. Joe knows Baseball more than you do…YEP! Even you. You sitting on your couch watching the game, ready to tweet your displeasure with the Yankee Skipper because he gave the starter the hook and went to Betances. Joe knows how to develop kids. Don’t agree?
Ask Gary, Aaron, Sevy, Clint, Birdie, Didi, Monty…shall I go on?",0

The owner of the New England Patriots football team thinks Donald Trump was divisive for his scornful words related to the NFL players “taking a knee’ during the playing of the National Anthem? I see that issue rather differently.
When President Trump stated that multi-millionaire football players were disrespecting our flag and the National Anthem by “taking a knee” he was simply expressing the attitude of most Americans. He was just responding to the disruption caused by the NFL players as they took up the leftist cause of America being rotten and insisting that the nation needs “fundamental” change, as was Obama‘s opinion. If you want to see what divisive looks like just consider the outrage and uproar that resulted from these acts of Barack Obama:
Barack Obama was divisive when he invited the Black Lives Matter group to the White House while they were celebrating the assassination of police officers nationally.
Barack Obama was divisive when he opened our borders to all who would illegally enter in contradiction to the laws passed by Congress.
Barack Obama was divisive when he defended the leftist sanctuary city bad idea and allowed not only illegals but criminal illegals to live in the United States with full immunity from the laws of our nation.
Barack Obama was divisive when he promised to “fundamentally transform America” as soon as he was elected to the Oval Office and then set about doing it.
Barack Obama was divisive when he ignored the obvious breaking of federal tax law by the IRS when they discriminated against Republicans prior to the 2012 election.
Barack Obama was divisive when he identified the Ferguson police force as being racist and nationalized it under his Department of Justice.
Barack Obama was divisive when he declared that Hillary Clinton had committed no crime as Secretary of State when she used her own personal email server to send and receive classified messages.
Barack Obama was divisive when he took up the banner of allowing men, who could at the drop of a hat self-identify as women, freely enter women’s restrooms across the nation.
Barack Obama was divisive when he stated that the American Constitution was a “negative” document instead of its being the revolutionary and liberating document that America’s founders put in place to protect average citizens from an intrusive government like the one Obama was putting in place.
Trump was just defending the interests and attitudes of his base, and no negative impact will stick to him for his bold, plain-spoken words. On the other hand, Barack Obama was certain that America was seriously flawed and needed large infusions of his radical medicine in order to get it thinking right again. Oddly enough, Obama’s opinion of America is the same opinion held by Adolf Hitler, Chairman Mao, and Joseph Stalin, just to put his ideas in proper perspective.

","US kidnapping: Man gives $9,000 reward money to victim","Image copyright Alexandria Police Department Image caption Mr Melchert (left, with police in Alexandria, Minnesota) said that the teenager he helped rescue is a 'real hero'
A man who helped a US teenager in her dramatic escape from three kidnappers has given his reward money of about $9,000 (£6,800) to her and her family.
Earl Melchert said that 15-year-old Jasmine Block and her relatives were more deserving of the cash than him.
Ms Block was held captive for 29 days in Minnesota and had been sexually and physically assaulted, police say.
But she escaped from the house where she was being held and swam across a lake to get to Mr Melchert's home.
""I thought at first it was a deer,"" Mr Melchert said.
The teenager knocked on the doors of several houses without anyone answering, before deciding to complete the swim and reach Mr Melchert's residence, the New York Times reported.
""I could make out her face, and I went, 'Oh my gosh, this is the girl from Alexandria that's been gone for 29 days',"" he said.
Police say that she was abducted in August by Thomas Barker, 35, a family acquaintance who told her that he needed help with a ""family situation"".
The teenager accompanied Mr Barker in his car - and when they arrived at his home, he allegedly tied her up with zip ties.
For the next four weeks Mr Baker and two other men sexually and physically assaulted her, police say.
They are alleged to have threatened her with weapons at various different addresses within the vicinity of Mr Melchert's home.
But Ms Block was able to escape when she ended up in an abandoned house near Mr Melchert's property in early September - after the men had left her alone for the first time in order to get some food.
The Alexandria Police Department on Friday offered Mr Melchert his reward money, but he refused to accept it.
""He believes that young lady that came running towards him that September day is the real hero and without hesitation, Earl handed the reward over to her, followed by a big hug,"" the department said on Facebook.
""Thank you Earl, it is people like you that make this world a better place.""
Mr Melchert - a recently retired fertiliser plant manager - for his part said it was ""the best thing I've ever done"".
""The family needs the money,"" he said. ""To me, yeah, that's a lot of money, but they need it way [more] than I do.""
Police have also paid tribute to Ms Block - describing her as ""amazing"" and a ""young lady with a lot of strength"".
The three alleged kidnappers are under arrest and in custody, police say.",1

",The Shocking Carol Woods Coverup: POLICE ALTER RECORDS + archive 11 Sept. 2017,"(Before It's News)
Now I have the police records 11 Sept 17
Dear all sent this, I do not send all emails often as I know people have their own troubles. This though I want you all to know because without your support at the crucial time anything could have happened to me.
After YEARS of trying to get a Section 7 Subject Access Request under the DPA 1998 Amended 2000, via Lancashire police, it still needed, even after I paid my £10 and took the 60 miles round trip to hand in my ID, the ICO involvement TWICE and now I have data they claimed did not exist.
Among that I consider the wrongful arrest and false imprisonment, illegal detention of me from Nov 2015 to March 2016 with the threat of arrest as soon as I was released from The Orchard.
The paperwork has all been changed.
The custody records of 7/8/ Nov 2015 I had to get a solicitor to help me obtain them as AGAIN the Gestapo ignored all my requests, faxed or otherwise. It was the first custody record I have ever managed to get and that was the help of a solicitor who would accept no money. His firm had been duty solicitors that night of Nov 2015 and NOT told I was arrested and asking for a solicitor. I was deprived of that basic right as usual. He was intrigued. (Incidentally when his firm wrote to me about the arrest of Feb 2012, delivered to 298 Oxcliffe Rd when I rented caravan 1A in Aug 2012, the roughneck Diane Lennon was alerted and she one to pose as me, called to 298 and claimed MY mail freely handed to her by the landlady. When I found out and told the firm they wrote again and that also “disappeared”. I gave up.)
I could see when analysing the data that details were incorrect and the FACTS had been recorded wrongly with INTENT. The odd thing then was they claimed they had no names of 3 “NHS professionals” in the station who “sectioned me”. There were other deliberately incorrect details but that is what I add here for you all.
In my Sec 7 SAR, AFTER the Gestapo were sent my analysis of how the custody record was totally false, they obviously decided to revise it. Now they don’t even refer to LES MARSHALL who was used as apparently the proof I was mentally ill was that I could not recall speaking to him for about 2 hours. No, I said, I did not forget, I stated I had never heard of him, seen him, spoken to him at all. The NHS confirmed Marshall had not worked for them in Nov 2015, was not in the police station and had not worked for them for years. But see how proof of my stating that was “proof” I was mentally ill.
Then more but the 3 on documents I have WERE NOT IN THE POLICE STATION THAT NIGHT AS I SAID ALL ALONG BUT NO ONE WOULD LISTEN. IT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO FIND OUT. I found out but after I was released.
What about the arrests: 1) “following someone to a local airport” aside from the fact we don’t have one – deleted from the records. 2) “harassing an 83 year old woman” (how was not stated) when I don’t know any – deleted from the records. 3) “taking photos of children” – deleted from the records. 4) “following someone to Kendal” no date, no person named,- deleted from the records. 5) “Someone (unnamed) had an injunction ordering me not to write to them” so as I pointed out the lunacy in that was that a person who did not know me went to the expense of going to court to ask for an injunction against me so I would not write to her (I am sure HER was referred to) as if a judge would do that! The solicitor I went to see to help me get the custody records made enquiries about that; there was never any injunction at all as he was sure there could not be on such drivel.
The latest “custody record” now has a NEW solicitor named as being on duty that night, one from Preston. AND THAT SHEET OF PAPER HAS MY SIGNATURE AS IF I HAD SEEN IT AND SIGNED. My signature is a photocopied one from the one the solicitor obtained for me. And on those custody records, there is no “south Lancaster” solicitor named at all; it is northern division.
And for those who still think I make things up then they have to conceded that my documents are scotch mist.
But for all of you who rang and made noises, you were right, I was right, they were wrong. Carol.
PS on a cheerful note, the Gestapo records show how they raised FOR POLICE EYES ONLY incident numbers for my “serious crimes” not exposed. One was “She has written to the Crime Commissioner”. I kid you not, there it is in black and white and other such utter rubbish.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/04/health/yemen-cholera-irc-footage/index.html,Yemen's cholera crisis laid bare in new hospital footage,"(CNN) New footage from inside several hospitals in Yemen reveals the crisis facing the war-torn country as it battles to contain one of the world's worst ever outbreaks of cholera.
The videos, provided to CNN by the International Rescue Committee, show children being treated for possible symptoms of the infectious disease in hospitals and mobile health units in the city of Aden and other areas in southern Yemen in late August.
A ravaged health care system, devastated infrastructure and near famine -- the results of a bloody civil war that began in March 2015 -- have all contributed to the spread of what the World Health Organization has described as ""the worst cholera outbreak in the world.""
The United Nations has counted 777,229 suspected cases as of October 2, many of them in children. As of September 13, there were 2,074 known deaths from cholera across the country, according to the WHO, with previous reports estimating that 5,000 people were being infected each day.
Mohammed Alawi Hadi, 6, and his brother Salih Alawi Hadi, 3, are treated for cholera at a hospital in Aden.
Sabah Abdullah Salim, whose 2-year-old son, Mohammed, has cholera, sought help from an IRC mobile hospital in Al Buraiqeh.
She told the IRC that her family fled the ongoing violence only to end up in a village without clean water.
""My son was crying, and he had diarrhea, and he started losing weight, so I brought him (to an IRC mobile hospital team),"" she said in the video. ""This makes me feel sad and stressed. I even cry. I would love to live in a place where there is no war and no illnesses.
""I hope one day we will be able to eat, walk, drink and live happily in our city and not keep on moving from one city to another and watch our kids suffer from different illnesses.""
Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness that kills tens of thousands of people worldwide each year. Infections are contracted by consuming food or water contaminated with the fecal bacteria Vibrio cholerae.
Last week, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross' delegation to Yemen warned that the number of cholera cases there would reach 1 million by the end of 2017.
Patients are treated at an IRC-run diarrhea treatment center.
""The cholera outbreak in Yemen is one of the worst I have ever seen in my 25 years of working in humanitarian aid,"" said Zvidzai Maburutse, the deputy director of the IRC's Yemen program. ""What is left of the health system in Yemen today is at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent.""
Maburutse, who spoke to CNN from Aden, explained that medicine, medical supplies and materials are in chronically short supply, and well over half of health facilities are only partially functioning or not functioning at all.
""To make matters worse, the local health workers -- those who play the largest role in trying to end this outbreak -- have not been paid their salaries for nearly 10 months, and operational costs in more than 3,500 health facilities are not paid. This cannot continue,"" he said.
JUST WATCHED What is cholera? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is cholera? 01:13
The conflict has meant that those who are most vulnerable are often impeded from accessing clean water and sanitation facilities, according to Maburutse, who warned that ""scores of innocent civilians will continue to die each day if new funding is not forthcoming.""
He said that if the $2.3 billion required to help maintain the UN Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan is not found, then the crisis could become far worse.
On Wednesday, the Global Task Force on Cholera Control -- made up of health officials from more than 50 organizations worldwide -- launched a new strategy to reduce cholera deaths by 90% by 2030.
JUST WATCHED UN: Thousands of children are at risk in Yemen Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH UN: Thousands of children are at risk in Yemen 02:18
According to the task force, cholera kills an estimated 95,000 people and affects 2.9 million more every year, and there's a threat that the epidemic in Yemen could spread to neighboring countries.
Though the new approach is likely to be welcomed, the need for action in Yemen is more pressing than ever.
""A lack of access to life-saving basic care will increase the risk of maternal and newborn deaths and communicable disease outbreaks,"" Maburutse said.
""It will lead to excessive -- and most importantly, avoidable -- morbidity and mortality from measles, cholera and diarrhea.
""The longer we wait, the higher the probability that this will spread beyond Yemen's borders.""",1

",California fires: Thirteen dead in wine country,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Fire survivor: 'I don't have any neighbours any more.'
At least 13 people have now died in fast-spreading fires that are ravaging parts of California's wine region.
A state of emergency was declared in northern areas after mass evacuations, with 2,000 structures destroyed.
About 20,000 people fled from Napa, Sonoma and Yuba counties in response to some the state's worst-ever wildfires.
Such fires are more common in southern California but a combination of dry weather and strong winds has fuelled the destruction in the north.

Cal Fire officials said on Tuesday morning that 17 wildfires in nine counties have burned more than 115,000 acres in just the past 12 hours.
Image copyright AFP/getty Image caption Fifteen fires were burning across eight Californian counties
""These fires have destroyed structures and continue to threaten thousands of homes, necessitating the evacuation of thousands of residents,"" Governor Jerry Brown said.
President Donald Trump has approved a disaster declaration for the fire-ravaged state, allowing federal emergency aid to be sent.
There is little sign the weather in the coming days will bring much relief to firefighters, BBC Weather says. More tinder dry conditions are forecast, with no rain expected.
Meanwhile, in southern California, a separate wildfire burnt 24 homes or other buildings in the wealthy Anaheim Hills area of Orange County, forcing thousands of residents to evacuate.

What do we know of the loss of life and damage?
The fires - considered among the deadliest in state history - have sent smoke as far south as San Francisco, located about 60 miles (96km) away.
A new fire is reportedly burning near the Oakmont area of Santa Rosa, a city that has already been devastated by the blazes.
Hundreds of homes have been destroyed in the city by flames so hot that glass melted on cars.
Details of how the seven people died in Sonoma were not immediately available, but country sheriff Rob Giordano said he expected the death toll to rise.
""There is a lot of burned homes and a lot of burned areas, so it's just logical that we're gonna find more people,"" he said.
Two people also died in Napa county and one in Mendocino county when thousands of acres burned in one valley.
Sonoma County officials said they had received more than 150 missing-person reports by Tuesday.
Authorities said they have found a few of the missing persons but most of the reports were still under investigation, Sonoma County spokesman Scott Alonso said.
Dozens of vineyard workers were reportedly airlifted to safety overnight.

Wineries belonging to the rich and famous were abandoned. One belonging to musician Dave Matthews was closed and at risk of being burned to the ground, staff said, as was the nearby Francis Ford Coppola Winery.
The vine harvest is already under way and many of the grapes have been picked.
Why did the fires spread so fast?
It is not yet known how the fires started on Sunday night but such blazes are particularly fast-spreading because of a combination of 60mph 96km/h) winds, low humidity and hot, dry weather.
Image copyright AFP/GETTY Image caption Officials say at least one person has died and about 1,500 buildings have been destroyed overnight
Ken Moholt-Siebert, a vineyard owner who thought his property had probably been destroyed after he and his family escaped on Sunday night, described the suddenness of the disaster.
""There was no wind, then there would be a rush of wind and it would stop. Then there would be another gust from a different direction. The flames wrapped around us,"" he told the LA Times.

The fires come in a year of record-setting heat and persistent drought, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

""This is exactly what you would expect in the Southern California fall fire season,"" Cal Fire director Ken Pimlott said.

This is the week when you have to start really making some choices. With the first four teams on scheduled byes, roster management will start coming into play. Carrying two defenses might be a luxury you can no longer afford, but that doesn’t mean we should stop streaming if it makes sense to do so. Let’s take a look at how the defenses rank for this week:
Minnesota Vikings – at Chicago Philadelphia Eagles – vs. Arizona Detroit Lions – vs. Carolina Pittsburgh Steelers – vs. Jacksonville Kansas City Chiefs – at Houston Buffalo Bills – at Cincinnati New York Jets – at Cleveland Jacksonville Jaguars – at Pittsburgh Baltimore Ravens – at Oakland San Francisco 49ers – at Indianapolis Oakland Raiders – at Baltimore Tennessee Titans – at Miami New York Giants – vs. LA Chargers Carolina Panthers – at Detroit Seattle Seahawks – at LA Rams
Notes:
Instead of targeting the Jets for your defense, it might be time to take a look at New York’s defense. A week after holding the Dolphins to a lone, last second touchdown, the Jets limited Jacksonville to 14 points last week. New York has two rookie safeties in Jamal Adams and Marcus Maye who have bolstered the secondary, and as a whole, they have looked sharper than they did the first two weeks of the season. Through four games the Jets haven’t generated much production, six sacks and four interceptions, but 20 points in the last two games is solid. It also doesn’t hurt that this week the Jets face the Browns who have allowed opposing defenses to rack up the second most points this season.
There is nothing better than taking advantage of a rookie quarterback making his first career start. It’s not like they generally take over in good situations, but it also helps that Chicago hasn’t had much success moving the ball. Conditions aren’t going to be ideal for Mitch Trubisky and, on paper, Minnesota has a strong defense. The results haven’t been there so far, but it’s really the lack of turnovers holding the Vikings back. They have given solid performances through four weeks, but they have three interceptions which all came against Jameis Winston. The Vikings will likely make things hard for the rookie as they have picked up 11 sacks so far this season.
Through the first four weeks of the season Detroit has the number one ranked fantasy defense. Other than last week against the Patriots, who haven’t shown much of a defense to speak of this season, Carolina has struggled to move the ball and generate points. Having Darius Slay to shut down the opposition’s number one receiver is a plus as the Lions have come up with seven interceptions and 10 sacks in four games while also scoring three touchdowns of their own. Despite his success last week, I have a hard time trusting Cam Newton and that means good things for Detroit.

",Americans Jailed After Failed Coup in Turkey Are Hostages to Politics,"But American officials have appeared powerless to secure their release, and it has become increasingly clear that the detainees are potential bargaining chips in a long-running effort by Turkey to force the American government to extradite Mr. Gulen.
Mr. Erdogan himself seemed to confirm the suspicion last month, when he told a gathering of police officers in Ankara that he would hand over an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, once the United States gave him Mr. Gulen.
“They say, ‘Give us this certain pastor,’” he said, recounting his meeting with American officials. “You have another pastor in your hands; give him to us,” he railed.
If Mr. Gulen were handed over, the president said, he would sort out Mr. Brunson’s judicial case. “Give him to us and we will put yours through the judiciary; we will give him to you,” Mr. Erdogan said.
At the same time, Turkish officials have repeatedly insisted that the detainees are charged with serious crimes of terrorism and trying to overthrow the state, and that if they are not guilty, the courts will release them in due course.
A presidential aide said in a recent interview that the government had been surprised by the scale of the Gulen network, and believed it had infiltrated nearly every major institution of power. The aide added that the authorities now faced an enormous task to dismantle it. He spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with the protocol of his position.

More than 50,000 Turks have been imprisoned and 150,000 more have been suspended from their jobs since the attempted coup in July 2016, which killed 249 people. The crackdown has stretched far beyond the immediate culprits and has swept up people with vague links to the Gulen movement.

The Americans are among them. For the families of the detainees, the drama has shifted from the surreal to deep dread.
Serkan Golge, 37, the NASA scientist of Turkish decent, was arrested in the first frenzy of suspicion and police activity after the coup attempt as he was vacationing in the sleepy southern town of Hatay.
Tipped off by a relative, the police arrested Mr. Golge outside his parent’s house as the family was leaving for the airport to return home to Houston.
At first, his relatives thought it was a bad dream. A year later, as a lengthy prison sentence appears imminent, they are in despair.
“His case is getting worse,” his wife, Kubra Golge, said tearfully in an interview as she cuddled her two small sons. “The lawyer said he no longer knows how to defend the case.”
Since then, she and her two sons, 7 and 19 months, all American citizens, have been barred from leaving the country.
The main evidence against her husband, she says, is the account he held at Bank Asya, a financial institution said to be owned by the Gulen movement, and a dollar bill found in his younger brother’s bedroom that is supposedly a secret sign of membership in the movement.
As the government has begun prosecuting hundreds of Turkish citizens on charges of instigating the coup, the pressure on the Americans and other foreigners has only hardened.

The missionary, Mr. Brunson, lived and raised a family for 23 years in the seaside city of Izmir before he was detained last October and accused of links to the Gulen movement. This summer, he was indicted on new charges of espionage, trying to overthrow the state and acting against the Constitution.
In a recent interview, a presidential adviser defended Mr. Brunson’s continued detention, saying that new evidence must have come to light to merit the additional charges.
But Ihsan Ozbek, the chairman of the Association of Protestant Churches in Turkey, a fellow pastor and a friend of Mr. Brunson’s, dismissed the accusations.

“Andrew was a normal American Christian; he is not a spy,” he said. “I know him; I know his wife and kids. It’s very sad.”
He suggested, as Western officials have, that foreigners like Mr. Brunson, an evangelical Christian missionary, were being held as hostages for political reasons by Turkey. The new charges came soon after the White House intervention.
A NATO member and a long-term ally of the United States, Turkey would never have dared to arrest Americans in earlier times, said Clyde Forsberg, an American professor who was detained in August last year.

“I was arrested because I was an American,” he said by telephone from the Kyrgyz Republic, where he now lives. “The only reason I was released was because I got lucky. It was very early in the game.”
Accused of aiding and abetting a terrorist organization, Professor Forsberg was released after four days in jail for lack of evidence, and he immediately left the country. The case against him is still pending, and he could have ended up incarcerated for months like Mr. Brunson, he said.
“He is still in prison, and that could have been me,” he said, complaining that United States officials had done little to help.

But appeals by American officials, including Mr. Trump, may have only persuaded the Turkish president that he was holding valuable assets that could be used as leverage over the United States.
Mr. Erdogan has also expressed anger at American court cases brought against his personal bodyguards, who are charged with attacking protesters in Washington in May, and a case against a former minister of Turkey and three others charged with conspiring to violate sanctions against Iran.
Perhaps the most high-profile case may be that of Mr. Brunson. The American vice president, who shares Mr. Brunson’s faith, has shown particular interest in his fate. So have the nearly 80 members of Congress who signed a letter to Mr. Erdogan in February asking him to release the missionary and saying he had been unjustly detained.
“There appears to be no evidence to substantiate the charges against him for membership in an armed terrorist organization,” the letter said.
Most of the other Americans detained hold dual citizenship in Turkey, and United States officials have even less ability to help them. Turkish law regards them as Turkish citizens and ignores their rights as Americans.
United States consular staff members have been given only limited access to the Americans in Turkish prisons and have not been able to visit the Turkish-Americans, such as Mr. Golge, at all.

Among them are Ismail Kul, a chemistry professor from Widener University in Pennsylvania, and his brother Mustafa Kul, a real estate agent. They were arrested in August 2016 at their home in Bursa during their summer vacation. They are accused of being members of the Gulen movement and playing a part in the failed coup.
At his trial, which is continuing, Ismail Kul admitted knowing Mr. Gulen but exposed the shakiness of the government’s charges when he explained that it was a member of Mr. Erdogan’s own ruling Justice and Development Party, Ahmet Aydin, the deputy chairman of Parliament, who first took him to meet the cleric.

“In 2010 I met Ahmet Aydin at a culture festival in Philadelphia,” Mr. Kul told the court, the nationalist daily newspaper Sozcu reported in January. “I had breakfast with him and his detail. They told me that they will see Gulen and suggested that I accompany them. That’s how I met Fethullah Gulen. After that, I visited Gulen four or five times.”
The United States Embassy in Turkey has expressed dismay that even local employees working at United States consulates have been swept up.
It issued a statement on Thursday saying that it was “deeply disturbed” at the arrest of a locally employed staff member in Istanbul. He was identified as Metin Topuz by the Turkish state news media, which said he was accused of having ties to Gulen members, spying and attempting to overthrow the government.
“We believe these allegations to be wholly without merit,” the United States Embassy statement said.
The spokesman for Turkey’s Foreign Ministry, Huseyin Muftuoglu, confirmed that Mr. Topuz had been detained on terror charges Sept. 25, but contended that he was neither a staff member of the American Consulate nor entitled to diplomatic or consular immunity.
Another United States Consulate employee, Hamza Ulucay, who had worked for 36 years in Adana, in southeastern Turkey, was detained in February and accused of having contacts with the Gulen movement and the outlawed Kurdish movement, the PKK.
Ms. Golge, 33, the wife of the detained NASA scientist, remains deeply shaken over the trial of her husband, who is expected to be sentenced this month. She describes the shock of his arrest as being like an amputation.
Her American life is gone. She lives with her husband’s parents and visits the prison once a week for a 45-minute chat on a phone through a glass window.

At NASA, her husband was put on unpaid leave. Unable to keep up their mortgage payments, she is selling their house in Houston.
Her husband is resigned, Ms. Golge said. “He is very sad,” she added. “He says, ‘I feel a lot of pain in my heart, but I know it is going to pass.’”
She is more blunt: “They took a hammer and crushed our heads.”",1

",Betting on CS GO With Bitcoin,"Betting on CS GO With Bitcoin
(Before It's News)
Betting on CS GO with Bitcoin
Online gambling can go two ways: it can either be extremely safe or become very risky. It all depends on the laws of the country or state that you reside in. Some countries don’t care about where you’re putting your money while others may just throw you in jail simply because you bet a penny on a Counter Strike GO match.
Take, for instance, the United States. Since gambling is outlawed, most people might prefer turning to the privacy offered by Bitcoin rather than going for traditional currency.
What Is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is basically money that you buy with money. Since it works pretty much as if you just bought something online from whatever website, how you use the product should be of no concern to anyone. As a result, you could use the bitcoins for esports Bitcoin betting.
However, it’s still tricky. Law enforcement learned this trick and is sometimes “stalking” for Bitcoin users as well. Traditional or online, bitcoins are still coins – and therefore, it’s still considered money. As a result, you may sometimes have to download the betting software to evade any prying eyes.
Why Go for Bitcoins When Playing CS GO?
There are many advantages to using Bitcoin in eSport betting. A Bitcoin gaming website, for instance, is much faster. When you use traditional currencies, most of the time you’d have to wreck your nerves to make the payment official. Introduce your details, get your acceptance, make your transaction, ensure that it’s legal; this may be just enough to make you lose interest in the betting session and miss the match in the meantime.
With bitcoin, however, you will only have to sign up using your email address. You will rarely find any other transaction processing fees, which means that the whole ordeal will be done rather quickly.
Furthermore, if it’s not legal in your country – you can make it legal. The wonderful thing about the Internet is the fact that it spreads worldwide – and that includes countries where online gambling is not considered an issue.
As a result, you may be a US player struggling with the laws of your state – but you could still be accepted on an outer website that allows players from the US. Since the website is not based on US grounds, you may not be bound by the law.
Here’s the kicker: if you used the traditional money, making the transaction would be all the more troublesome – you’d either have to make the conversion or hide from the law enforcement the fact that you’re betting on a game using your bank account. With bitcoin, however, most problems are done with. Bitcoins represent universal gaming currency – so regardless of the country, you won’t have to go through many struggles. It’s the same money, but less of a headache.
Winning CS GO Skins
Why do we bet during our Counter Strike GO game plays? It’s quite simple. We never really bet because we want to cash in the money and use it in real life; we bet because we want to use that money in the virtual world. We want to buy the skins and weapons necessary to win the tournaments that CS GO launches from time to time.
Well, some betting websites want to make things even simpler for us. Instead of playing for money, you are playing for skins. They may only look fashionable and fancy, but they are great help when it comes to protecting your hero in a CS GO gameplay.
These skins are also valuable in the real world. You can trade them for all you want – cash or bitcoins. The choice of how you use the winnings is pretty much yours. We bet on CS GO because we want to be the winners – so no matter if you use the prize to pimp your hero or pay your bread, you have all the freedom. eSport betting is convenient this way.
We are all gamblers – at least to some extent. If we don’t take the risk, we don’t win. Even when your take your hero in CS GO to some dark tavern, you take a risk – you have no idea who might creep up on you and end your game.
When you are betting with Bitcoin, there’s still some risk – but the focus is on the risk of losing the bet rather than the risk of getting caught and thrown in jail. It’s a method that is supposed to make your gaming experience a little more enjoyable – and less stressful. It will be lucrative and entertaining at the same time and, if you are lucky, it will also be rewarding. Give CS GO betting a try and may the odds be forever in your favor!",0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/business/ford-chief.html,Ford Chief Outlines Investment Shift Away From Passenger Cars,"Putting more emphasis on introducing new trucks and S.U.V.s while also managing the transition to vehicles that lack an internal-combustion engine, or even a driver, will require a dual focus.
Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Autotrader.com, said Ford might find the transition difficult. “Straddling the now and the future will be tricky especially in terms of profitability,” she said.
At an appearance in New York that was also webcast, Mr. Hackett acknowledged that the company faced significant challenges. “The decision to change is not easy — culturally or operationally,” he said, adding that the approaches that have brought success in the past “are really no guarantee of future success” as the industry is reshaped.
An immediate area of emphasis will be connected vehicles, which collect data about their operations and surroundings that can be used to improve safety and provide new digital services. “Our vehicles will be smart and connected,” Mr. Hackett said.
By 2019, all new Ford models in the United States will be able to transmit data back to the company or its business partners, a step toward creating mobility services like ride-hailing and traffic avoidance. The company is planning a similar rollout in China. By 2020, 90 percent of all new models, regardless of market, will offer such connectivity.
As part of that push, Ford is developing software that will enable vehicles to communicate with one another and with sensors along roadways and in traffic lights.

Ford’s initiatives come as the industry’s incumbents are scrambling to match outsiders like Tesla, Google and Uber, who are making big advances in automotive technology. On Monday, General Motors presented a plan to introduce 20 all-electric models by 2023, including two in the next 18 months.
In addition to revisiting its development priorities, Mr. Hackett vowed that Ford would become more efficient, cutting billions in material costs and engineering expenses over the next five years. Ford has average profit margins of about 6 percent in recent years, short of its goal of 8 percent. “That’s not good enough,” Mr. Hackett said.

Mr. Hackett, a former chief executive of the office furniture manufacturer Steelcase, joined Ford’s board in 2013 and its executive ranks last year. His predecessor as chief, Mark Fields, had come under pressure because of a decline in profits and a sagging stock price.
While Mr. Fields was a polished salesman and marketer, the company struggled to plot a course as the industry was reshaped by electric vehicles, autonomous technology and ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft.
It was a reversal of fortune for Ford, which had been the only one of the three Detroit automakers to escape bankruptcy as the recession and financial crisis set in.
When he arrived, Mr. Hackett promised to review all of Ford’s businesses and operations, and prepare a plan within about 100 days for improving its “fitness” and strategic direction. Since then, he has said little in public.
In June, Mr. Hackett announced that Ford would import a new version of its Focus small car from China. Ford had planned to build a $1.5 billion plant in Mexico but canceled it in January after it met stiff opposition from Donald J. Trump, then the president-elect.
In the four and a half months since Mr. Hackett’s ascent, Ford has elevated its share price by 14 percent, including 2 percent in Tuesday’s trading session. But in the same period, G.M.’s shares have risen 33 percent, and Fiat Chrysler’s are up 71 percent.
Ford reported net income of $2.04 billion in the quarter that ended June 30, an increase of almost 4 percent from the same period a year ago. But the rise came mainly because of a big profit in its credit arm and a cut in its tax bill. Its auto operations in North America suffered a 19 percent drop in operating profit in the quarter.",1

","Another Mass Shooting, Another Grab For Guns","By Tony Cartalucci
Nothing is more deplorable than hijacking human tragedy to push an unrelated political agenda. A mass murderer taking the lives of some 60 people in Las Vegas this week has nothing to do with the majority of lawful firearms owners in the United States who aren’t and have no intention of ever killing another human being.
Yet the knee-jerk reaction of many emotionally-driven people in the face of an overwhelming tragedy is to shift public debate back to gun control and even banning guns altogether.
Emotional and irrational responses in the face of overwhelming circumstances is part of human nature and require patience.
Yet another part of being human is then appealing to our ability to reason. To reason we must have facts.
Upon examining the following 6 facts, we will see that access to firearms has no significant relationship to violence – and that violence is driven by another entire set of factors that must be addressed if we honestly want a more peaceful and prosperous world.
1. According to the FBI, more people die of barehanded assaults in the US per year than all rifle violence (“assault rifles” included) combined. In fact, homicide via personal weapons like hands and feet is more than double homicides carried out with rifles.
Most gun homicides are carried out by handguns in some of America’s most destitute communities where national and local governments have failed to keep up with infrastructure, providing education, or economic opportunities. Cities like Detroit who have had their industry shipped overseas and their infrastructure left to – in some cases literally – rot.
2. According to the Small Arms Survey conducted by the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland, the United States has the most guns per capita of any other nation on Earth at 112 guns per 100 people. Second place goes to Serbia at 58.21 guns per 100 people.
Based on this and assumptions that access to firearms equates directly to more violence, we would expect to find the United States and Serbia at the top of list regarding both homicides, and gun related homicides, yet this is not the case at all.
3. Highest homicide rate on Earth goes to El Salvador with 108.64 murders per 100,000 people. The United States comes in at number 94 with a murder rate of 4.88 per 100,000 people.
4. El Salvador’s gun homicides are at around 26.49 per 100,000 people while the US comes in with 3.60 gun homicides per 100,000 people. Honduras comes in first place with 66.64 gun homicides per 100,000 people.
Nations topping the list of gun homicides together with total homicides reveal little relationship between the number of guns per capita and actual violence. In fact, despite the immense amount of firearms in the United States, the United States has a relatively low homicide and gun-related homicide rate. This is why gun ban advocates often attempt to cite “gun related deaths” which includes accidents and suicide instead of citing gun-related homicides – even when advocating gun bans after high-profile mass shootings and murders.
5. Gun ban advocates often claim the United States cannot be compared with “failed states” and instead should be compared with “advanced states” like Denmark, Sweden, etc. This is called “cherry picking” and is a logical fallacy, not rational or honest debate.
Neither El Salvador nor Honduras are “failed states” according to the Fragile States Index.
And neither Denmark nor Sweden have a “Detroit” like the US does. During a debate, all data must be considered, not conveniently and conditionally picked through so the numbers add up in one’s favor.
6. Despite the UK and Japan both being “gun free” – according the the United Nations (summarized on Wikipedia here) – the UK has a higher total number of murders (594) than Japan (395) despite having half of Japan’s population (UK: 65.64 million, Japan: 127 million).
For those tempted to claim that the UK isn’t actually gun free, realize that – according to USA Today – only about 50-60 murders a year in the UK are attributed to firearms, and if negated, still leaves the UK with higher total murders, and a still much higher murder rate than Japan.
Concluding Thoughts
All 6 facts tell us that violence is driven by socioeconomic factors, not access to firearms. If firearms drove violence, the United States would be by far the most violent nation on Earth, followed by Serbia – they are not. The UK and Japan would have roughly the same rate of homicides – they do not.
If you truly care about a more peaceful world, address the root causes of violence – which is clearly, obviously not access to weapons. Those who intentionally stir hysteria and prey on the emotions of well-meaning people to push issues like gun control have ulterior motives – and coincidentally allow all of the actual factors that drive violence – socioeconomic disparity and destitution – to continue or even expand.
If you are truly against violence, you must truly commit yourself to understand what really causes it, and not indulge in emotional campaigns pursuing irrational measures that not only will not stop violence, but will invite great amounts of the very exploitation and injustice that drives violence.
Banning guns did not stop terrorists in Europe from obtaining completely illegal AK-47s used in Paris, France killing over 130 people, nor did banning guns stop a terrorist from using a truck in Nice, France to take the lives of over 80 people. Gun bans did not stop the alleged hijackers of the planes used on September 11, 2001 to kill nearly 3,000 people. They used box cutters.
Those who are determined to carry out premeditated mass murder like that which unfolded in Las Vegas, will do so no matter what implements they have at their disposal. Figuring out what factors actual cause an individual or organization to contemplate and carry out mass murder is the only way to stop or reduce future acts of violence.
Examining the heavily medicated, violent, and intentionally divided population of America and the socioeconomic doldrums they inhabit would be a good place to start.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Germany’s DEA Deutsche Erdoel won the rights to partner with Mexican national oil company Pemex on its onshore Ogarrio project, the industry regulator said on Wednesday.
The tie-up marks only the third joint venture between the Mexican oil giant and a equity partner since a sweeping energy opening finalized in 2014 ended Pemex’s decades-long monopoly and allowed the firm to jointly develop projects with private and foreign oil companies.
Ogarrio is a 60-square mile (156 sq km) field located in Tabasco state believed to contain 54 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in proven, probable and possible reserves.

",Sir Michael Stoute: Ulysses leads the way for resurgent veteran,"Sir Michael Stoute is all set to post his most lucrative ever campaign for prizemoney in Britain
Darley Dewhurst Stakes Venue: Newmarket racecourse Date: Saturday, 14 October Time: 15:00 BST Coverage: Commentary on BBC Radio 5 live
As the 2017 Flat racing season reaches its final furlong, Sir Michael Stoute is all set to post his most lucrative ever campaign for prize money in Britain.
More than £3.5m - just short of his personal best, achieved in 2003 - has been banked already, principally following the exploits of Ulysses.
A winner at Group One-race level in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown and the International Stakes at York, the four-year old also finished runner-up to star filly Enable in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot.
In France, he was a gallant third (behind Enable again) in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.
However, a whole lot of other horses have played big parts too for the Newmarket string, notably St Leger runner-up Crystal Ocean, Ballet Concerto - the winner of three races on the trot before tragically collapsing and dying on the gallops - Convey and the Queen's number one horse Dartmouth.
The results have sparked talk of ""a resurgence"" for the trainer, champion on 10 occasions between 1981 and 2009, and whose five Epsom Derbys include success with Shergar (1981).
Those numbers demonstrate that Stoute's never exactly gone very far away, but it's just that whereas once he hogged many of the headlines, these days that's more the preserve of his near-neighbour John Gosden and, of course, the all-conquering Aidan O'Brien.
Stoute doesn't disagree.
""I've won more group races this year than I have for a few years so I am having a resurgence,"" he said.
""We've got some nice horses doing well, which is great for the whole team, and what Ulysses has done has been very satisfying.""
Expert Eye is the favourite for this year's renewal of the Darley Dewhurst Stakes, taking place at Newmarket's Rowley Mile on Saturday
Addressing the subject of the County Tipperary-based O'Brien squad, as it bears down on the record for Group One victories in a year (25), he continued: ""I don't think we've seen a battalion like Aidan's before.
""It's quite incredible really, but I just get on with my job.
""That [O'Brien's domination] is a fact. If you can't handle it, run away.""
Meanwhile, signs for the remainder of the year, and indeed for beyond, look particularly rosy for Stoute and his string at Freemason Lodge, in Newmarket's Bury Road.
It looks likely that Ulysses will travel to Del Mar, California for the Turf race at America's Breeders Cup fixture in November, before retiring to be a stallion at the prestigious Cheveley Park Stud.
Closer to home, Poet's Word has the Champion Stakes on British Champions Day at Ascot on 21 October his agenda, while the unbeaten and much-touted two-year-old colt Expert Eye is targeting the Darley Dewhurst Stakes on Dubai Future Champions Day at Newmarket.
Oh yes, Expert Eye.
You don't need to be any sort of expert to spot the potential of the son of the stallion Acclamation, another talent, like Frankel, Kingsman, Enable et al, from Saudi prince Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte racing and thoroughbred breeding empire.
Striking successes at Newbury and then Glorious Goodwood - by four and a half lengths, with the third, fourth and fifth all winning subsequently - have sent him soaring to the top of the reckoning for the 2,000 Guineas in May 2018.
More immediately, he's hot favourite to give Stoute a first win in the Dewhurst Stakes, traditionally the outstanding race for racing's youngest participants, since he took the spoils with Ajdal in 1986.
During five decades of training, the 71-year-old (first runner: 1972) has had charge of plenty of youthful talent - the fillies Marwell and Russian Rhythm spring readily to mind - but recently the biggest names have tended to emerge more slowly, aged three.
Trainer Michael Stoute secured a sixth Coral-Eclipse triumph thanks to Ulysses (far side)
Stoute said: ""We have had precocious two-year-olds, but we don't seem to get them now [but] this fellow has come along and is naturally precocious.
""He's the best two-year-old I've had for a while.
""Before he ran we knew he was pretty smart; he's a good-looking horse, very athletic, very well balanced.""
Expert Eye, who'll be ridden in the Dewhurst Stakes, as at Goodwood, by jockey Andrea Atzeni, is described as being ""in good shape"".
""It was a very good performance at Goodwood,"" said the trainer, ""and the form has worked out. We didn't know he'd win like that, but we knew he'd win.
""I contemplated going to The Curragh with him [for the National Stakes, September] but he had a bit of an infection so that knocked that out of the way.
""We've had plenty of time to prepare him - there will be no excuses on that front.
""You are never quite sure of the opposition, but he seems still in good form.""
While others are getting excited about Expert Eye's 2018 prospects, Stoute, who believes the one-mile distance of the 2,000 Guineas will be his optimum, refuses to get carried away.
""Let's see what happens [in the Dewhurst] and go from there,"" he said.",1

",What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Mr. Robot’ and ‘Riverdale’,"Photo
As Halloween approaches, dark, violent shows like “Mr. Robot” and “Riverdale” return for new seasons. And a Halloween classic comes to Netflix.
What’s on TV
MR. ROBOT 10 p.m. on USA. Elliot Alderson has had two rough seasons. The hacker, played by Rami Malek, has battled anxiety, a prison stint, drug addictions and sinister corporations. But in the third season, which starts Wednesday night, he tries to turn over a new leaf, with some help from his friend Angela (Portia Doubleday). “He’s become a more conscious, responsible human being who is looking to right the wrongs that he’s made and grown into more of a man,” Mr. Malek told The New York Times last week.

RIVERDALE, 8 p.m. on the CW. “Twin Peaks” meets “Gossip Girl”? Welcome to the world of “Riverdale,” an adaptation of the Archie comics that imbues its teen-show tropes with a moody, noir edge. (“The terrific art direction warps the bubble-gum iconography into something haunting and lurid,” James Poniewozik wrote in his review in The Times.) While the first season’s central question — who killed Jason Blossom? — was solved, a host of disturbing new mysteries have materialized. The first episode of the second season, “A Kiss Before Dying,” follows Archie as he drags his wounded father to the hospital and speculates over who attacked him.
FRONTLINE: WAR ON THE EPA 10 p.m. on PBS, check local listings. As Oklahoma’s attorney general, Scott Pruitt fought the Environmental Protection Agency for years. Now he runs the agency, and on Monday he announced his intention to repeal President Obama’s signature policy to curb greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. This documentary traces the rise of Mr. Pruitt, his anti-regulatory movement, and the skepticism about science that pervades the country.
What’s Streaming
CHANCE on Hulu. Hugh Laurie playing an unstable, biting doctor isn’t a new idea. But “Chance,” Mr. Laurie’s show on Hulu, arguably goes into more sinister and deranged territory than “House” ever did. Mr. Laurie plays Eldon Chance, a neuropsychiatrist consultant who reads horrific patient reports but doesn’t do anything to affect the patients’ lives — until he becomes entangled with one and plunges into the seedy side of San Francisco. In Season 2, a detective coerces him into helping him take down a serial killer.

DONNIE DARKO (2001) on Netflix, YouTube and Google Play. There are few Halloween movies better than “Donnie Darko,” which arrives on Netflix on Wednesday. A young Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie, a disturbed high schooler haunted by doomsday visions, bullies and a metallic rabbit giving him commands. “Mr. Gyllenhaal’s long, open face seems like a wound here; his every state of mind bleeds onto the screen,” Elvis Mitchell wrote in his review in The Times. The corkscrew narrative creeps along with sharp, acidic turns, splashes of foreshadowing and a sense of dread. The movie’s reality should be questioned; the anxious pounding of your heart should not.",1

Tom Heneghan just reported everything he’s learned from his US Intelligence sources. I’m including pieces of intel I’ve found from various sources on the net such 4chan that are very interesting. Nobody ever has all the pieces of such a complex plan but I feel Tom has a lot of the pieces along with other researchers I’m posting.
 
Listen to the video above for the full briefing. Here’s some of the highlights of what Tom Heneghan has found out from his sources.
 
Tom says H.W. Bush, Hillary Clinton, DHS and British Intelligence linked G4S security are involved with the shooting. British security firm G4S is linked to British intelligence and they were involved with the Orlando nightclub shooting and the Christine Grimme shooting in Orlando! G4S also ran the security for all the airports involved in 9/11! Now we have many people saying they saw security guards chasing other security guards. They used security guard uniforms to get away!
 
 
Tom says Paddock became the patsy for the shooting. This shooting was a blood sacrifice done by a very skilled team of killers. It was a warning to Trump from the Bush Clinton deep state that we can do this anytime we want so back off locking us up! It was also a grab for the guns as they always do.
 
Marilou Danley, the girlfriend of Paddock was working as an FBI informant for years according to Heneghan’s sources! She was sponsored to get into the country by a CIA agent! I have that proof of this below that came from 4chan researchers. 
 
Tom says British G4S is very capable of putting together a murder squad to do this shooting.
 
Stephen Paddock and his girlfriend Marylou Danley were bag man and bag woman for FBI Division #5 and casinos involved in money laundering, narcotics trafficking and foreign currency manipulation
 
Brian Hodge saw multiple shooters and was somehow made aware that a security guard was shot! Did he overhear police and others talking about this since he witnessed SWAT storming the building. I have more evidence that other people in another casino witnessed security guards chasing another security guard!
 
Brian Hodge – said there were multiple shooters and a security guard was killed! Ignored by Fake CIA US mainstream news of course!
 
 
Australian Brian Hodge, who previously worked at Jupiters Casino on the Gold Coast, claimed he was staying in the room next to the shooter on level 32 at the Las Vegas resort.
 
He said he managed to escape the initial horrific scenes inside the hotel but found himself forced to hide in a bush for several hours after the event.
 
“I got outside safely and was hiding in bushes,” Mr Hodge said.
 
“There were multiple people dead and multiple shooters. I was just hiding waiting for police to come get us.

At first I thought Hodge was in his room when the shooting broke out and he was saying that it came from his room but he was not at his room! If you read what he is saying, he says he was caught outside when the shooting started and hid in the bushes around the hotel until it was over. He had heard police say it was coming from the room next to his and said, hey that is right next to me! He must have heard they killed a security guard which ties in with Tom Heneghan’s information that British Intelligence tied G4S was involved just as they were involved in the other shootings! We also have reports from another casino that security guards were chasing a security guard! Clearly people in security guard uniforms were involved! Is this G4S? 
 
British Intelligence linked G4S Security tied to other shootings according to Tom Heneghan and even mainstream news!
 
June 18, 2016 Tom Heneghan Intelligence Briefing …We can now divulge that James Wesley Howell of Indiana was on the payroll of British Intelligence linked G4S
 
Note: Omar Mateen the shooter who slaughtered 49 Americans in Orlando, Florida was also employed by British Intelligence linked G4S.
 
We can also report that Kevin James Loibl of St. Petersburg, Florida, who killed Orlando singer Christine Grimme, on the Friday night before the Omar Mateen slaughter, was also employed by British Intelligence linked G4S.
 
Both were also G4S “crisis actors” in the Terror Drill that took place in Tampa, Florida the end of May.
 
DHS has contracted British Intelligence linked G4S to handle security at 90% of America’s nuclear plants.

Proof Stephen Paddocks’s girlfriend – Marilou Danley was tied to the CIA!
 
Here’s some interesting things I found by researchers on the Internet. All this must be further investigated by the alternative media.
 
“Marilou Danley” immigrated to the US under the name “Marilou Ocampo Natividad” in 1986, married Geary Danley in 1990 and took his surname.
 
Prior to immigrating, Marilou was a known Muay The and Eskrina fighter under the alias, “Marilou Ocampo” and became politically active in the late 1970s. As an elected local official in the mid 1980s, she became embroiled in the controversy over American Development Aid covertly provided by the CIA to promote pro American sentiment during the lead up to and in the wake of President Marcos resignation. 
 
Researchers say they found Marilou Danley’s immigration records and she was sponsored by a spook – a CIA agent! 
 
When she immigrated, she was sponsored by Carl W. Ford Jr. Here’s a link to a bio somebody found on Carl W. Ford.
 
https://kek.gg/i/7dZP8X.png
 
Here’s the key part of the Carl Ford’s bio 
 
“Mr Ford resigned his Regular Army commission in 1974 to accept a position as China analyst with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
 
…
 
In 1979, Mr Ford left the CIA to become the professional staff member responsible for East Asia on the Senate Committe on foreign relations”

https://kek.gg/i/63PS4q.png
 
So the CIA got Stephen Paddock’s girlfriend into the country! Very interesting! 
 
 
Fake CIA News – Newsweek just retracted their story that Marilou Danley used multiple social security numbers and was married to two men at the same time. If she was working for the CIA then anything is possible. Sounds to me like somebody at Newsweek got a call from Langley and told them to shut up about Marilou – she’s one of ours!

Guests at hotels in Vegas told by police and hotel staff 7 confirmed shooters and deaths at multiple hotels!
 
Ricki Raulerson reports this on facebook
 
…
 
“Call me crazy, call me dramatic, call me whatever you want. I’m posting this for those of us who were on the strip Sunday night, who know what we saw and what we were told by police officers, security guards, and even the local news when all of this madness started. And I am posting this in hopes of informing others who have believed everything they’ve seen on the news. If while leaving the Cosmopolitan, we had been told there was one shooting at the Mandalay Bay, Anthony and I would have not been worried for our lives and we would have continued to go out, knowing we weren’t headed to that particular area of the strip. But that’s not what we were told. We were told that there were 7 confirmed shooters, and confirmed deaths at multiple hotels. Including Bellagio, the Aria and New York New York. Being told this by a security guard, who then told us to go to the third floor for safety. However, Anthony says, “No Rikki. This is a very popular hotel, I don’t feel like the third floor of this popular hotel in public is the safest place. We’re going to try and get out of here right now.” Running back to our hotel next door, Vdara, we are told once again by police/security checking our id and room key, “yes multiple hotels effected. Go to your room and do not leave.” We then get to the room, immediately turn on the news and start watching out of our windows to figure out what is going on. The news also states, live, that the Bellagio had been effected and there was one confirmed death. 
 Now… skip ahead about an hour. The news is no longer stating anything about the other hotels effected. They say it is one person. Every bit of info that was being initially given to us was disappearing. We could physically see from our window view, fire alarms going off at the cosmopolitan, and multiple cop cars and ambulances pulling up there as well. We wanted more information about what was happening at these other hotels right next to us, and we weren’t getting it. And we still aren’t.”

Guests saw security guards chasing heavily armed men dressed as security guards!
 
Another Gold Coast woman and local business owner Jessica Winters said she and her partner Peter Tutton were locked out the back of the MGM Grand nearby after being evacuated from an internal restaurant twice.
 
Wendy Miller from Cooroy, on the Sunshine Coast, was also caught up in the attack.

",Organization May Be Forced to Return Paid Patriotism Funds Again,"By Aaron Kesel
Amid the kneeling protest during the national anthem, the NFL may be forced to return taxpayers’ funds. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) on Tuesday called for an end to all federal government support of the NFL.
“I believe we ought to terminate all federal government support of the NFL,” Brooks told Breitbart News.
“That would include the termination of any and all advertising that is done on behalf of the federal government — military and nonmilitary — to the extent we do any.”
“The same thing with any other professional sport that insults our country and our flag and our anthem as the NFL has done,” he added.
The NFL reportedly receives billions of dollars in subsidies from local taxpayers and governments, CNN reported in 2015.
Another 2015 report from NJ.com revealed that more than a dozen NFL teams received money from the Defense Department between 2011 and 2014 in exchange for promoting the military during games and other forms of advertisement.
From 2011-2014, the Department of Defense spent $5.4 million in contracts with 14 NFL teams for flag ceremonies. Even the U.S. National Guard got in on the action and gave $6.7 million to the NFL from 2013 to 2015.
The protest started last year as a way to highlight the racial inequality in America and fight back against police brutality.
This isn’t the first time the organization would be forced to return funds for “paid patriotism.”
In 2016 the professional football league was forced to agree to return $723,734 that it was paid by the Defense Department to honor the military. In a letter to the two Arizona senators, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said an audit uncovered that over the course of four seasons $723,734 “may have been mistakenly applied to appreciation activities rather than recruitment efforts.”
McCain and Flake, who released a letter demanding the NFL pay back taxpayers’ funds previously issued a report in November of that year criticizing the NFL and other pro sports organizations for taking taxpayers’ money to put on events at games honoring the troops, a practice they called “paid patriotism.” That report found that the Pentagon had “inappropriately” paid up to $6.8 million to both professional and college sports teams, CBS reported.
The total paid out for patriotic displays at sporting events was a much more outrageous $53 million in spending on marketing and advertising contracts, SB Nation reported.
Flake was pleased with the NFL’s response returning the money which he called “egregious federal spending.”
“In all the years I’ve spent rooting out egregious federal spending, the NFL is the first organization to perform due diligence, take responsibility and return funds to the taxpayers,” Flake said. “The NFL’s response to this investigation sets a new standard and only strengthens its reputation as a supporter of military service members and veterans.”
McCain equally praised the NFL for giving back taxpayers’ funds tweeting that he applauded the effort.
I applaud @NFL for returning American tax dollars used to honor our troops – time for other leagues to do the same. https://t.co/vLEBOy2qno — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) May 19, 2016
According to the report by McCain and Flake, this practice was supposed to be addressed with the NDAA in 2016.
We successfully had the 2016 NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act] amended to restrict the DoD’s spending on paid patriotism in its professional sports advertising contracts.
So this raises a question about what other federal funding from taxpayers the NFL is receiving besides money from the Pentagon for patriotic displays? Which again, are supposed to be discontinued as mandated by law.
Before 2009 NFL players didn’t even stand for the National Anthem; it was a marketing strategy to push military recruitment.
But then the Department of Defense and the National Guard got involved. They began to pay the NFL millions of dollars to have flag ceremonies before games and have players on the field.
ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith covered this issue on ESPN’s First Take in 2016, when players first began the recent on-field protest trend:
As part of the new relationship between the DOD and the National Guard, the NFL changed its practices and began bringing players onfield during the playing of the national anthem for some “inspiring” displays of heartfelt patriotism. The outrage over yesterday’s widespread refusal to continue the practice is proof positive that the DOD’s marketing dollars hit their mark. “Patriots” who never noticed the change in 2009 have been suddenly driven into a frenzy over players’ refusal to continue being used as props in the NFL’s high-priced performance of “America.”
Even paid Senate Armed Services committee war porn poster boy leader John McCain has admitted the practice is wrong.
Given the immense sacrifices made by our service members, it seems more appropriate that any organization with a genuine interest in honoring them, and deriving public credit as a result, should do so at its own expense and not at that of the American taxpayer. Americans deserve the ability to assume that tributes for our men and women in military uniform are genuine displays of national pride, which many are, rather than taxpayer-funded DOD marketing gimmicks. FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad) (Source)
In 2015, Senator McCain and the Senate Oversight Committee issued a statement along with a corresponding report condemning the practice of “paid patriotism,” as charades, “conducted not out of a sense of patriotism,” but rather done “for profit in the form of millions in taxpayer dollars going from the Department of Defense to wealthy pro sports franchises.”
The report continued to detail its findings:
Unfortunately, contrary to the public statements made by DOD and the NFL, the majority of the contracts—72 of the 122 contracts we analyzed—clearly show that DOD paid for patriotic tributes at professional football, baseball, basketball, hockey, and soccer games.v These paid tributes included on-field color guard, enlistment and reenlistment ceremonies, performances of the national anthem, full-field flag details, ceremonial first pitches and puck drops. The National Guard paid teams for the “opportunity” to sponsor military appreciation nights and to recognize its birthday. It paid the Buffalo Bills to sponsor its Salute to the Service game.vi DOD even paid teams for the “opportunity” to perform surprise welcome home promotions for troops returning from deployments and to recognize wounded warriors.
NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy later confirmed that players did not appear on field for the anthem until 2009.
This controversial topic was briefly discussed on MSNBC this week, when NFL player Marvin Washington mentioned the financial relationship between the DOD and the NFL. Civil rights activist Jesse Williams also expressed the paid patriotism in an MSNBC interview this week, calling the national anthem a “scam.”
“This is not actually part of football. This was invented in 2009 from the government paying the NFL to market military recruitment to get more people to go off and fight wars to die,” Williams said. “This has nothing to do with [the] NFL, or American pastime, or tradition. … This is to get boys and girls to go fly overseas and go kill people. They’re marketing. They’re pumping millions and millions of dollars into the NFL to get us to put on a pageant in front of the NFL football games to get you to go off and fight.”

",Fourth ex-governor from Mexico's PRI arrested on corruption charges,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A former Mexican governor wanted on corruption charges was arrested on Friday, officials said, marking the fourth detention of an ex-governor from the country’s ruling party so far this year.
Eugenio Hernandez, who served as governor of the northern border state of Tamaulipas from 2005-2010, was arrested in the state capital of Ciudad Victoria. He is accused by both Mexican and U.S. authorities of embezzlement and money laundering.
Hernandez served as a member of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which for decades has been battered by corruption scandals.
Corruption promises to be one of the major issues in Mexico’s July 2018 presidential election, with public discontent widespread over a spate of conflict-of-interest rows that have dogged the Cabinet and Pena Nieto himself.
The rows could play into the hands of leftist presidential hopeful Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a two-time runner-up who presents himself as an anti-corruption crusader and is the front-runner in the polls.
Prosecutors alleged that in 2007 Hernandez bought a state-owned 1,600-hectare property through an associate, allegedly paying 16 million pesos ($862,730) for the land despite an estimated value at the time of slightly more than 1 billion pesos.
The land was previously sold in 2002 to an associate of Tomas Yarrington, Hernandez’s predecessor as governor of Tamaulipas, for 14 million pesos, while at the time its value was pegged at 866 million pesos, the prosecutors said.
Hernandez and his lawyer could not immediately be contacted for a response and have not made a public statement.
Yarrington himself was arrested in April in Italy and has been charged in the United States for presumed ties to drug trafficking. He has not made a public statement since his arrest.
Two other former PRI governors were also arrested earlier this year.
In April, Javier Duarte of Veracruz state was arrested in Guatemala, accused of siphoning off millions of dollars from state coffers. He has denied any wrongdoing.
Meanwhile, Roberto Borge of Quintana Roo state was arrested in Panama in June just as he was about to board a flight to Paris. Mexican authorities have requested his extradition.
Borge is accused of illicit enrichment, embezzlement and abuse of public office. He has denied the allegations.

http://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/41511970,Japanese GP: Lewis Hamilton position 'not comfortable at all',"They get into Formula 1 early in Japan: Lewis Hamilton high-fives a young fan while signing autographs at Suzuka
Lewis Hamilton says he is ""not comfortable at all"" with his position in the championship despite a sizeable lead over rival Sebastian Vettel.
The Mercedes driver is 34 points ahead of Vettel heading into Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix with 125 available in the remaining five races this year.
Hamilton said: ""I am under no illusion. I might have the nail a little bit in, but I need to keep hammering it.
""It is not done until there is no more to push it in.""
Hamilton has gained 31 points on Vettel in the past two races after problems for the German and his Ferrari team.
""There are so many points available and you have seen other years where things swing,"" Hamilton added.
""The pendulum can swing. I am hoping if it starts to swing the other way we have enough force to push it back to where it should be.""
Ferrari have been quicker than Mercedes in the past two races but both their cars crashed out together at the first corner in Singapore and Vettel finished fourth in Malaysia after starting from the back because of an engine problem.
Asked to rate his chances of overhauling Hamilton, Vettel said: ""We have a chance. I tend not to rate many things. I think there is a chance and we make sure we use it.
""We are behind so it depends on what Mercedes are doing. We just have to do our best and we need to score much more than them. How we achieve it doesn't matter as long as we do achieve it.""

'If the car was perfect every weekend, it would be boring'
Mercedes had a difficult weekend in Malaysia, where they expected to be more competitive than they were.
Hamilton said Mercedes had ""definitely still question marks"" about the car's performance but added: ""I saw some stories that we had been thrown off the ball or are on the back foot. We're not.
""We are still leading the championship, we still have a great car. Each race is really just about trying to understand more about the car because there is constantly something new coming in the mix that can catch us off guard.
""That is the exciting thing about this car. If the car was perfect every weekend, it would be boring and we are enjoying the fact we are being challenged and that she is not the easiest.
""I don't know if any of you guys can predict but I definitely can't predict what races are going to work and what are not. We thought we'd be stronger in the last race but we were way off but we still got pole and finished second.""
The weather forecast for Suzuka is for a wet day of practice on Friday before drying up into the weekend.",1

http://www.disclose.tv/news/september_23rd_doomsday_numerologist_now_says_apocalypse_actually_starts_in_october/140361,September 23rd doomsday numerologist now says apocalypse actually starts in October,"End of the world prophet now claims October will be the beginning of the end.
 
There has been a considerable alarm in certain circles owing to the predictions that September 23rd, 2017 will be the day that the world comes to an end. However, now one of the most prominent proponents of this worrying theory, David Meade, has stepped in to claim that this is a misunderstanding.
 
David Meade, an astronomer, and author has stepped in to reassure the world that things will not come to an end on the 23rd September. Instead, he says that there will be celestial events on this date which he refers to simply as ‘time markers’. He has also said that while the mainstream media have reported that these celestial events will be visible that he does not believe that they will be.
 
Despite this word of reassurance, Meade has not rolled back on his prediction that the end is nigh. He says that the month of October will be the ‘beginning of the end’ with regards to life on the planet. He says that beginning with the 21st of October that there will be a seven-year period of tribulation. During this time, the elusive planet Niburu will come close to the Earth’s orbit and wreak various forms of disaster upon humanity. It has even been suggested that the drawing close of Niburu could trigger some kind of event that could be interpreted as the coming of the antichrist or the rapture.
 
Meade’s words have been met with alarm by some people, but others are far more incredulous, pointing out that end of the world prophecies have been made with some regularity in the past and yet have never come to pass. However, given the sudden, unprecedented spate of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes in addition to the growing political problems in the world which could lead to the outbreak of an all-encompassing world war, perhaps the end truly is nigh after all.

A 4-page leaked document containing an expense report of a kidnapping of teenage girl Emanuela Orlandi, the 15-year old daughter of a Vatican employee who mysteriously disappeared in the center of Rome in June 1983, is being authenticated as we speak. The Orlandi family is upset with recent news and is demanding answers.
“This document suggests the Vatican took Emanuela to London and looked after her for a long period of time,” said Emanuela’s brother, Pietro, who has lobbied Pope Francis for help in finding the truth.
Father Gabriele Amorth, who was appointed by the late John Paul II as the Vatican’s chief exorcist and claims to have performed thousands of exorcisms, said Emanuela Orlandi was later murdered and her body disposed of.
In the latest twist in one of the Holy See’s most enduring mysteries, he said the 15-year-old schoolgirl was snatched from the streets of central Rome in the summer of 1983 and forced to take part in sex parties.
“This was a crime with a sexual motive. Parties were organised, with a Vatican gendarme acting as the ‘recruiter’ of the girls.

(Before It's News)
On Sept. 29, 2013, the Baltimore Ravens lost to the Buffalo Bills and their rookie quarterback EJ Manuel, 20-13, in Orchard Park, N.Y.
However, Manuel was not the difference in that game.
Instead, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco threw five interceptions, including one on a potential game-tying scoring drive in the fourth quarter. It was an all-around poor performance by the Ravens, who missed tackles, dropped passes and committed several careless penalties.
It’s been a familiar script for both of the team’s losses here in 2017, four years later.
On Sunday, the Ravens get another crack at Manuel, who was named the Raiders’ starter with Derek Carr out with a back injury.
The Ravens appear to have caught a break, because Carr has torched their defense over the past two seasons. Last year at M&T Bank Stadium, Carr threw four touchdown passes, including the go-ahead score to Michael Crabtree with 2:12 left in the game, paving the way for Oakland’s 28-27 victory.
However, it doesn’t matter who starts at quarterback for Oakland if the Ravens can’t find a way to play better on both sides of the ball. Otherwise, Manuel might improve to 2-0 against them.
Earlier this week, Flacco took full responsibility for the team’s recent woes. In four games this season, Flacco has completed just 73 of 118 pass attempts for 601 yards with four touchdowns and six interceptions. He is hoping this week will be different.
“I think I’ve been a little bit quick to get the ball out of my hands, at times,” Flacco said. “I think if I just hang in there and trust the process, trust the pocket … I might have to step up and make some plays here and there. I think when some of those big plays are presented to us – they’re there, they’ve been pretty easy; you can make them in your sleep – and we haven’t made them. I think the combination of those three things can definitely go a long way.”
While Flacco has struggled to make plays, the loss of offensive lineman Marshal Yanda has clearly hampered the team. Flacco has been sacked six times over the recent two-game losing streak, prompting more questions about his health.
The offensive line will literally have its hands full again on Sunday. Oakland defensive ends Khalil Mack and Mario Edwards Jr. have combined for seven sacks and will spend the afternoon trying to make life miserable for Flacco and his injury-marred offensive line.
The Ravens are fully aware of that challenge.
“They have a number of pass rushers. It is not just those guys. ‘96’ [Denico Autry] is a really good pass rusher, too,” Harbaugh said. “They have a number of guys that can get to the quarterback. They get good push from their nose guard and from their three-technique. It is a very good front five; it is a very good front seven.”
On the other side of the ball, the Ravens have given up 339 yards on the ground in the past two games with nose tackle Brandon Williams out of the lineup with a foot injury. Williams is still unable to practice this week and that could spell further trouble. Even though Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch has struggled to make plays this season, he is fully capable of a break-out performance.
In short, this is shaping up to be another tough game for the Ravens. The cross-country trip is not going to help. Under Harbaugh, Baltimore is just 3-5 on the West Coast.
Luckily, Oakland is not as far as London.

","A Day of World Cup Magic, Around the World","Panama, a victor against Costa Rica, will be there for the first time — thanks, in part, to a goal that did not happen. It was such an auspicious occasion for the country that the next day was immediately declared a national holiday. The United States, beaten by Trinidad and Tobago, will not be there, the shining brilliance of Christian Pulisic not enough to prevent the country from missing its first finals since 1986.

Honduras might yet qualify, thanks to a win against Mexico, but only if it can beat Australia, which edged past Syria, the decisive goal coming after 199 minutes of 210. That is one of the intercontinental playoffs for a place in Russia; the other features New Zealand and a Peru team indebted to David Ospina, the Colombia goalkeeper, and an eagle-eyed referee. Peru and Colombia tied, 1-1, in Lima. Peru’s goal came from Paolo Guerrero, scoring direct from an indirect free kick. Had Ospina not touched it, the ball would still have gone in, but Peru would be out. Such are the margins. In recent days, such has been the drama.
So great is the lure of Europe’s club competitions and so compelling are the endless soap operas around their teams, that it is easy for those in the countries that have appointed themselves the sport’s heartlands to be dismissive of international soccer.
The Champions League, after all, is now the game’s gold standard, where greatness is achieved and contested. Pelé and Diego Maradona built their legends at World Cups, back when that was the only place where the very best assembled, and when it was the only time much of the rest of the world could see, and assess, them. Messi and Ronaldo, by contrast, meet their peers every other week in the Champions League, and do so in front of an audience of millions.
Photo
Domestic competition, too, is so much more compelling now: the cut and thrust of the Premier League, awash with unimaginable sums of money, and the glamour of Barcelona and Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Juventus. Soccer’s rapid globalization in the last two decades has meant that these are the jerseys players dream of wearing, these are the competitions that they dream of winning, and these are the teams to whom fans lend their hearts, every week, every month, every year.
Internationals, by contrast, are an afterthought and an inconvenience. Attendances across Europe, even in Italy and Spain, suggest a lack of engagement: Games are regularly moved to smaller stadiums in a bid to generate atmosphere, but even that cannot always mitigate against the sight of vast swathes of empty seats. In England, which has the national team that regularly draws the largest crowd, the conviction has taken hold that it does not matter that much anymore, that the club game is the sport’s engine.
Such is the privilege of success. Europe’s superpowers qualified for Russia while barely breaking a sweat: England, Spain and Germany all finished the campaign unbeaten. Germany, the world champion, did not so much as drop a point. Portugal, France and Italy lost only once. It is not boring because it does not matter; it is boring because it is easy.

To the people pouring out of their homes to celebrate in Iceland, in Egypt, in Panama, to Kristian Mora, screaming himself hoarse, international soccer matters, in a way that club games rarely, if ever, match. Millions tune in to the Premier League, or the Champions League, or a clásico, in all of those places. Very few national holidays are declared.

And yet, it was impossible to watch all that joy without wondering if it might be for almost the last time. This is one of the last qualification cycles for a 32-team World Cup. In 2026, thanks to FIFA’s ruling earlier this year, 48 countries will qualify.
The rationale is clear. The emotion of qualifying is international soccer’s appeal, its unique selling point, and yet it can be lost. Australia’s late winner and the United States’ eventual defeat were 14 hours apart, and yet few could have taken in both games and all the nail-biting sport in between. The kickoff times were too diffuse; the distances too great; work and sleep and time got in the way.

Far better, then, for all of that drama to be bottled and stored and released in a concentrated form, as part of the finals themselves. That way more people can watch; that way, more people will pay. To FIFA, drama only counts if it can be monetized.
There is a fundamental misunderstanding here. Costa Rica did not explode with joy, or Panama declare a national holiday, or Egyptians flood the streets because they expect to win the World Cup. It was an outpouring of joy simply for being there, for achieving something rare and wonderful.
As soon as being there becomes an expectation, an obligation, that joy disappears. That is when international soccer does become boring. FIFA set out to transform the World Cup because — officially — it felt that the more people invited, the better the party. It just forgot that part of the thrill, part of the appeal, is in receiving that exclusive invitation in the first place.",1

",Police don't know why Las Vegas gunman fired -- or why he stopped,"(CNN) Police on Monday said the Las Vegas gunman shot a hotel security guard six minutes before he began shooting concertgoers from his hotel room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino -- a striking change from an earlier police timeline detailing what happened.
Given that revised order of events, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said investigators do not yet know what made Stephen Paddock stop shooting, and they remain perplexed as to why he meticulously planned the shooting in the first place.
Here's what we learned about the investigation and the questions that remain unanswered in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.
Security guard was shot before mass shooting
Authorities said last week that security guard Jesus Campos had approached Paddock's room as the shooting was underway, diverting the gunman's attention. Authorities also said that after Paddock shot at Campos through the door of his room on the 32nd floor, the gunman didn't fire any more shots into the crowd.
However, Lombardo said Monday that Campos was shot in the leg at 9:59 p.m. on October 1. Six minutes later, Paddock began firing into the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, authorities said. Fifty-eight people were killed and nearly 500 were hurt.
He continued firing for nine to 11 minutes, and his final shots were fired at 10:15 p.m., according to police.
Officers reached the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m., according to Lombardo's timeline. By the time a SWAT team used an explosive charge to enter the room at 11:20 p.m ., Paddock was dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Lombardo said that Campos, upon being shot, immediately notified security of his situation, and his action helped identify the location of the suspect. In addition, Campos prevented a maintenance worker on the same floor from suffering injuries, the sheriff said.
Police did not know Campos was shot until they met him in the hallway of the 32nd floor after getting off the elevator, Lombardo said.
What exactly happened in the six minutes between Campos' getting shot and the mass shooting on concertgoers? Who did the security guard alert, and what was their response? Why did it take officers 18 minutes from that point to reach the gunman's floor?
And why did Paddock stop firing?
Lombardo said that the revised timeline constituted ""minute changes"" and is based on new information that emerged over the course of the ongoing investigation.
""As I have conveyed to you from the very beginning -- and your zest for information and my zest to ensure the public's safety, and the calming of their minds -- is some things are going to change,"" the sheriff said.
In a statement Tuesday, MGM Resorts, which owns the Mandalay Bay, said: ""We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline that has been communicated publicly, and we believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate.""
A law enforcement source close to the investigation disputed the MGM statement. ""Our timeline is pretty accurate with all the facts known,"" the source said Tuesday.
Security guard heard drilling
JUST WATCHED New video shows concertgoers fleeing scene Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New video shows concertgoers fleeing scene 02:57
Campos had been investigating an alarm that went off in another room on the same floor, signaling that a door had been left open, Lombardo said. Once there, the guard heard a drilling sound in Paddock's room, and he was then shot through the door.
The gunman had been drilling into the adjacent wall to the doorway, according to Lombardo. His assumption was that Paddock intended to place either a camera or a rifle there, but the drilling was not completed, Lombardo said.
Did the gunman's firing at the security guard speed up the timeline of the shooting?
""I would not make that assumption,"" Lombardo said. ""I'm not privy to that.""
Gunman hid his prep work
Why did Paddock open fire on the crowd at the outdoor music festival, an attack that seems to have been meticulously planned? And why did he stop shooting?
Lombardo admitted that he was ""frustrated"" by the speed of the investigation in answering those questions.
""It isn't because nobody is not doing their job,"" he said. ""It's because this individual purposely hid his actions leading up to this event and it is difficult for us to find the answers to those actions.""
Investigators are still piecing together evidence left behind in the hotel room and probing Paddock's background to determine why the retired accountant did what he did.
""As I've said from day one, we want to figure out why -- the why to this and we'd like to know the motive,"" Lombardo said. ""That is our most important goal -- to prevent any further action associated with another individual who is contemplating this or what exactly went in the suspect's mind to enable him to pull off such a complicated event.""
Investigators said Paddock acted alone, and Lombardo said they have found ""no evidence to show there was a second shooter.""
The sheriff said authorities have received 200 accounts of Paddock traveling throughout Las Vegas, and that he ""has never been seen with anyone else.""
Lombardo said the FBI is still evaluating Paddock's mental state.
""Currently, we do not believe there is one particular event in the suspect's life for us to key on,"" the sheriff said. ""We believe he decided to take the lives he did and he had a very purposeful plan that he carried out.""
Suspect's family members interviewed
Investigators have interviewed the suspect's brother, Eric Paddock, and other family members, according to Lombardo. He declined to discuss the interviews, but said each one was another piece in the puzzle in this case.
""I'm here to help them move forward with their investigation. I want to help them understand what they're seeing,"" Eric Paddock told the Las Vegas Review-Journal
He did not describe what investigators asked him during their conversations over the weekend, according to the Review-Journal.
""I'm trying to get them to understand Steve's mindset,"" Paddock told the newspaper. ""I don't want them to chase bad lead.""
Lombardo said on Monday that law enforcement is also talking to Marilou Danley, the shooter's girlfriend.
""We are still speaking with Ms. Danley about the suspect's movement, gun purchases, and anything else we need to know about him and how he planned his assault -- and who he came in contact with during the planning the phase,"" the sheriff said.
Authorities first interviewed Danley , who was in the Philippines at the time of the shooting, last week. In a statement released through her attorney, Danley said she did not know about Paddock's plans ahead of time, and she saw no signs that she understood to be a warning that ""something horrible"" would occur.
Danley's sisters told CNN affiliate Seven Network Australia that Paddock bought a ticket for Danley to leave the United States last month.
""She was sent away. She was sent away so that she will be not there to interfere with what he's planning,"" one of Danley's sisters said from their home in Australia.",1
http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/04/media/facebook-burr-warner-briefing/index.html,Senate Intel chair: point of Russian ads 'seems to have been to create chaos',"""If you look from 10,000 feet,"" Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr told reporters at a briefing Wednesday, ""the subject matter"" of the 3,000 Russian-bought Facebook ads that have been turned over to his committee ""seems to have been to create chaos in every group that they could possibly identify in America.""
The Kremlin-linked group that has been tied to those ads seems to have been trying to spread that chaos all over the country. Some of the Russian-bought Facebook ads specifically targeted swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Florida, as well as other states whose Electoral College votes were not truly contested during the election, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
Facebook has said that roughly one-quarter of the 3,000 political ads bought by the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency were geographically targeted. CNN has confirmed that states targeted included Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin.
In both Michigan and Wisconsin, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton by less than one percentage point.
Related: Exclusive: Russian-linked Facebook ads targeted Michigan and Wisconsin
Altogether, the 3,000 Russian-bought ads reached roughly ten million people, Facebook said earlier this week. As CNN has previously reported, the ads touched on a range of hot-button issues, including immigration, the Second Amendment, race and refugees. Some touched on Trump and Clinton.
The ads have been turned over both to Congress and to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team, but at the Wednesday briefing, Burr said that his committee would not be releasing the material it has gotten from Facebook.
""The Senate Intelligence Committee does not release documents provided by witnesses, companies -- whoever, whatever the classification, it's not a practice that we're going to get into,"" Burr said, echoing similar comments he had made previously. But, he added, ""Clearly if any of the social media platforms would like to do that, we're fine with them doing it because we've already got scheduled an open hearing because we believe the American people deserve to hear firsthand.""
Shortly after he said that, a Facebook source told CNN that the company has not changed its position, either, and it will not be releasing the ads. The source pointed to the rationale Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch gave last month for not publicly releasing the ads, saying it intended to protect user information.
Despite any jockeying between Facebook and the Senate committee over who -- if anyone -- would release the ads, Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement after the Senate committee's briefing that ""It is my strong opinion that all of the Facebook advertisements purchased by the Russians should be made public.""
Asked at the briefing whether his committee had seen ""any evidence of a nexus between these Russian Facebook ads"" and any political campaign, Burr put off answering.
""We haven't even had our hearing yet,"" he said. ""Let us have the opportunity to have these folks in, ask them the questions. In many cases, [the Russians] didn't even take advantage of the most technical targeting tools that exist within those social media companies, so I would defer answering your question until we've completed the investigation.""
Facebook intends to testify in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee at a hearing next month, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN Wednesday. Google and Twitter have also been invited to testify.
Some of the targeted states had previously been reported by NBC News.

",John Green Tells a Story of Emotional Pain and Crippling Anxiety. His Own.,"“Turtles All the Way Down,” published on Tuesday, Oct. 10, is Mr. Green’s most personal book yet. Its narrator, Aza Holmes, is a 16-year-old girl in Indianapolis who wrestles with anxiety and obsessive thought spirals. Aza has normal teenage preoccupations, and struggles to navigate the rites of adolescence: dating, fretting about college, calming her overbearing mother, appeasing her demanding best friend.
But she is also frequently overcome by extreme dread. She’s certain that she’s contracted an intestinal bacteria that can be fatal. She worries that a cut on her finger, which she presses on uncontrollably, will become infected and kill her. She starts drinking hand sanitizer. She often wonders if she is fictional: If she can’t direct her own thoughts, who is really in control?
“Turtles All the Way Down” is an emotionally fraught project for Mr. Green, whose young adult novels are beloved for their quirky humor and sharp, sensitive teenage protagonists. His books have more than 50 million copies in print worldwide; two have been adapted into films. Mr. Green, 40, who lives in Indianapolis with his wife, Sarah Urist Green, and their two children, Henry, 7, and Alice, 4, is one of the publishing industry’s biggest stars, and over the past decade, he and his brother Hank have built an online video business with 16 educational shows that have collectively drawn more than two billion views on YouTube.
Mr. Green’s onscreen persona for YouTube shows like “Crash Course” is ceaselessly energetic and positive. But he has wrestled with weighty subjects in his books — his young characters battle illness and mortality, depression and bullying — and has occasionally addressed his own mental health issues. In a video posted this summer, he discussed how difficult it is to talk about his experience of obsessive compulsive disorder, in part because language so often fails to capture abstract feelings.

With “Turtles All the Way Down,” Mr. Green tried to bridge the language barrier by bringing readers inside Aza’s consciousness, subjecting them to her anguished obsessions. Now, with the book’s release, he’s speaking to fans and interviewers about something deeply painful and personal.
“I want to talk about it, and not feel any embarrassment or shame,” he said, “because I think it’s important for people to hear from adults who have good fulfilling lives and manage chronic mental illness as part of those good fulfilling lives.”
On Monday, Mr. Green started his book tour with an event in Manhattan, where more than 100 fans gathered to see him and his brother put on a variety show of sorts. Mr. Green apologized for the slapdash quality of the performance — it was a rehearsal — then read passages from his novel that describe Aza’s debilitating fear about the wound on her finger. He told the audience that her crushing anxiety paralleled his own experience.

“I spent a lot of my childhood consumed with obsessive worry and dread,” he said, adding that he hoped the novel would “help people who struggle with that terror to feel less alone.”

Mr. Green was about 6 years old when he first became aware of his obsessive thought patterns. He was often afraid that his food was contaminated, and would only eat certain foods at particular times of day.
As he got older, he was able to keep his anxiety in check, with the right mix of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy. But every once in a while, uncontrollable thoughts can overwhelm him.
It happened once when he was 24, living in Chicago and working as a book reviewer for Booklist. He was so depressed he couldn’t eat, so he drank a couple of two-liter bottles of Sprite a day. Sometimes he couldn’t get up from his kitchen floor, where he lay staring at the bubbles in the soda bottle. He couldn’t read the books he was supposed to review because he couldn’t parse the words on the page.
He went to stay with his parents, saw a psychiatrist and found the right medication. He returned to Chicago, where he began writing what would become his debut novel, “Looking for Alaska,” a semiautobiographical novel about a boarding-school student who is bullied. He sold it to Dutton for a tiny advance, and went on to publish several more acclaimed young adult novels, including “Paper Towns” and “The Fault in Our Stars,” the story of two teenagers with cancer who fall in love, which became a global best seller. Sudden fame was unsettling. Mr. Green, anxious about touching strangers, found himself at events, confronting crowds of fans, some of whom wanted to hug him and take photographs.
Writing provided some relief, though he is careful to separate his creativity from his illness. At his sickest, he’s unable to think coherently enough to write.
“For me, it’s a way out of myself, to not feel stuck inside myself,” he said, adding, “I want to be super careful not to claim there’s some huge benefit to this brain problem that I have.”
In 2015, Mr. Green again suffered a severe onset of anxiety. It had been three years since he published “The Fault in Our Stars,” which became a megaseller, with more than 23 million copies in print worldwide, and was adapted into a feature film. Following up a success on that scale felt impossible. Mr. Green started and abandoned several novels. He worried he might never write another book.
Then, hoping to jump-start his creativity, he went off his medication. He plummeted. “I can’t think straight — I can only think in swirls and scribbles,” he wrote about the experience.

When he recovered in late 2015, he started writing the new novel, and finished a draft. He spent another year revising it with the help of his longtime editor, Julie Strauss-Gabel, who called the novel an “unbelievable act of translation” that gives readers a glimpse of what it’s like to suffer from mental illness. “He has worked really hard as a human being to figure that out,” Ms. Strauss-Gabel said.
Hank Green said that when he first read the novel, he felt like he understood for the first time what it must feel like to live with obsessive compulsive disorder: “Even having a brother who deals with OCD, I never really got it until I read the book.”
In the book’s acknowledgments, Mr. Green thanks his doctors and notes how fortunate he is to have a supportive family and mental health care that many don’t have access to.
“It’s not a mountain that you climb or a hurdle that you jump, it’s something that you live with in an ongoing way,” he said. “People want that narrative of illness being in the past tense. But a lot of the time, it isn’t.”",1

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/technology/google-pixel-hardware.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology,Google’s New Gadgets Come With a Big Helping of A.I.,"Google executives said it has been getting harder to find new hardware breakthroughs like bigger and better screens, but they believe significant improvements will come from artificial intelligence software that is developing at a faster clip than physical components.
Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior vice president of hardware, compared the company’s strategy for building devices to search and email. Google was not the first search engine and Gmail was hardly the first free web-based email provider — but both services reimagined what those products should do.
Last year, the company started its “Made By Google” line of hardware products, headlined by the Pixel smartphone. The handset received positive reviews, but it did not threaten the premium smartphone dominance of Apple or Samsung.

View all New York Times newsletters.
On Wednesday, Google demonstrated how every hardware product had received an A.I. makeover. The Pixel smartphones come with an image-recognition app called Lens that can help users find information just by pointing a camera at a movie poster or an ad. The new “smart speaker” uses artificial intelligence to adjust its sound for the layout of a room. And new wireless headphones allow for instant translation of different languages.
The question of Google’s commitment to hardware is a testament to the challenges of competing against devices made by Apple, Amazon and Samsung. Most other companies have found it hard to turn a profit in that product fight, and a flop can follow a company around for years — both in money and reputation lost.
It is also a recognition of Google’s history of fits and starts with devices. The company once acquired Motorola, only to sell it a few years later to Lenovo. It bought Nest and Dropcam, but the introduction of new products from those home device companies seemed to stagnate after they joined Google, now operating under the parent company, Alphabet.
Whether Google’s device push sticks over the long haul remains to be seen, but its checkbook for hardware is still open.
Last month, Google said it had agreed to acquire a team of 2,000 engineers from the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC for $1.1 billion. The hardware-focused personnel came from an HTC research and development division that was already working with Google to create the Pixel phones. Google said the acquisition will allow it to move faster in its efforts to develop new features for smartphones.
The deal is expected to close, pending regulatory approval, early next year.",1

Gov. Jerry Brown, the top liberal in a state lousy with them, just signed California’s death warrant. The governor signed “sanctuary state” legislation on Thursday, which will sharply limit how and when local law enforcement officials can cooperate with federal immigration agencies. The bill, known as SB 54, will become official state law in January.
Democrats are hailing it as a major step in the oh-so-honorable war on the Trump administration – a chance for California to stand up and protect its 2 million illegal immigrants from deportation. Great news for them, great news for the businesses that depend on them for cheap labor, but not-so-great news for California citizens who value the rule of law. Or the economy. Or, in many cases, their lives.
Under the new law, state and local law police agencies will be prohibited from using either manpower or funds to detain illegal immigrants unless they have been convicted of specific crimes. In other words, they will not only be empowered to tell ICE to take a hike, they will not have the authority to cooperate with federal immigration detainer requests even if they want to – which many law enforcement personnel throughout California do. ICE agents WILL still be allowed to work with state corrections officials, only because it was a concession the Senate had to make to get the bill onto the governor’s desk. But even there, detainer requests will be a no-go.
In a statement, Gov. Brown tried to ease fears that California was now an unlimited haven for illegal immigration.
“In enshrining these new protections, it is important to note what the bill does not do,” Brown wrote. “This bill does not prevent or prohibit Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the Department of Homeland Security from doing their own work in any way.”
Gee, how magnanimous. The bill does not prevent the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT from doing its work to enforce FEDERAL LAW. Brown doesn’t explain how the bill WOULD do that, since that would have been a remarkable accomplishment short of California seceding from the Union.
“California is building a wall of justice against President Trump’s xenophobic, racist, and ignorant immigration policies,” said Senate President Pro Tem Kevin De Leon at a press conference.
God, could you get any more trite?
In the debate between law and lawlessness, citizen and illegal immigrant, America and chaos, California has cast its lot. If you happen to live there, now would be a fine time to think about moving.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/04/health/teacher-pay-and-status/index.html,Teachers' Day: Where teachers are paid well and valued most,"(CNN) All over the world, proud parents drop their children at the gates of schools, dreaming about what they might accomplish after years of study and homework. They entrust teachers with the duty of nurturing their development and opening their eyes to a world of possibilities. It's a huge responsibility -- but is that responsibility reflected in their social status and pay?
October 5, is World Teachers' Day, so here's a look at how the world values teachers.
Global teacher status
A 2013 study by the Varkey Foundation looked at the social status of teachers and found that there was great respect for teachers in many Asian societies -- especially in China, South Korea and Singapore. For much of the Western parts of the world, levels of respect were lower.
The Global Teacher Status Index found that of the 21 countries surveyed, on average, teachers ranked 7th in a poll on 14 respected professions, just above social workers and librarians. China was the only country where teachers were considered as highly skilled as doctors.
Professor Peter Dolton, author of the Global Teacher Status Index which compared attitudes to teachers in 21 countries, said that teacher status measures differently ""based on the history and values and mores of a particular culture"".
For example, he cites New York City, where society is focused on financial earnings, status correlates to how much a teacher is earning. Whereas in China, where cultural norms are to respect your elders, teachers are given higher status despite the lack of a high salary.
Countries with a higher respect for teachers are more likely to encourage their child to enter the profession, the report states. China, South Korea, Turkey and Egypt are most likely to give encouragement to children to become teachers, while Israel, Brazil, Portugal and Japan are the least likely to provide positive encouragement, the report noted.
Prof. Dolton is working on the next report which will come out in 2018, and he said it will importantly include Latin America and Africa, which the first report did not.
High level teacher training
Finland and Singapore have vastly different approaches to teaching, yet both produce some of the most successful students in the world.
""If you look at South Korea, Singapore, Finland, teaching has been given status, teachers are treated well, paid well and so much professional development has gone behind them,"" said Vikas Pota, CEO of the Varkey Foundation. Government will, he says, is 99% of the reason for this.
""You need teachers who really care. The state has a role to play,"" said Pota.
Singapore is top of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) education rankings based on international tests taken by 15-year-olds in math, reading and science. The tests, run by the OECD and taken every three years, measure global school league tables.
The most recent PISA results showed that the Asian education system was ahead of most of the results, with the top seven places in math taken by Singapore then Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Japan, China and South Korea.
Asian schools tested most highly in the last PISA results, with Singapore first in math, reading and science.
Canada, ranked 10th in math, third in reading, and seventh in science, is the highest-ranking non-Asian country in the overall results. Finland, which came in at 13th place in math, was fourth and fifth in reading and science worldwide, was the highest-ranking European country.
These countries have vastly different ways of teaching, but they all place a great value on teachers, said OECD education director Andreas Schleicher.
""What you (teacher) do have in Finland and Singapore is an amazing career. You own your professional practice and that drives job satisfaction and quality,"" said Schleicher.
Canada, too, which ranks very highly in the PISA results, has a very strong emphasis on the quality of teaching, says Schleicher.
In Singapore, all teachers have training at the National Institute of Education and are selected from the top tier of graduates.
But more importantly, in Singapore teachers have more than 100 hours of professional development every year, said Schleicher. ""There's a lot of investment in the teacher training,"" he said.
In Finland, getting into a teacher training program is already an honor. Finnish teacher education programs are extremely selective, admitting only one out of every ten students who apply, according to the National Center on Education and the Economy (NCEE).
""It should be no surprise that Finland has a very high retention rate for teachers, with about 90% of trained teachers remaining in the profession for the duration of their careers,"" said the NCEE.
Teachers in Finland, unlike most places in the world, are qualified to a masters degree level, explained Prof. Dolton.
With all the top-achieving countries, Schleicher said there is one thing in common: ""It's not about pay, but the status of the profession is more a result of it being intellectually attractive to become a teacher.""
Where teachers are paid the most
Europe ranks as the best place to teach in terms of salaries, according to the OECD report which includes 35 countries. In Luxembourg, for example, starting teachers' salaries are greater than what many teachers will see in their lifetime.
Switzerland and Germany are the next top highest-paying countries for teachers at the high school level. Six out of the top 10 salaries for high school teachers are in Europe.
""Since compensation and working conditions are important for attracting, developing and retaining skilled and high-quality teachers, policy makers should carefully consider teachers' salaries as they try to control both quality teaching and sustainable education budgets,"" wrote the OECD in its latest report on education around the world.
The economic downturn in 2008 has had a direct impact on teachers' salaries, which were either frozen or cut in some countries, says the OECD.
Between 2005-2015, teachers salaries have decreased in real-terms in one-third of the countries with available data. ""The decrease reached about 10% in England and Portugal, and up to 28% in Greece,"" said the OECD.
Salaries do not correlate with outcome, but teacher status does correlate with outcomes, says Schleicher. ""If you want to make the job attractive, give them good support.""
Winner of the 2017 Global Teacher Prize, Maggie MacDonnell, teaches indigenous communities in a village called Salluit in the Canadian Arctic.
Boosting the status of teachers
In 2013, the Global Teacher Prize award was created by the Varkey Foundation.
The prize has around 20,000 applicants a year, and narrows it down to 50 finalists, then 10, before declaring one $1 million prize winner.
The award has gained a lot of press attention, it's helped to raise the status of teachers, but it's also had a positive impact in creating a network of teachers who can collaborate globally to help each other.
""Quite simply, we want to celebrate teachers,"" said Pota. Teachers are being asked to go on TV talk shows in Turkey. In Macedonia, the Mayor took out every billboard in their town and put up posters of the teacher to congratulate her. In the Netherlands, a teacher was on the news with the prime minister thanks to their nomination.
""The award is putting into consideration the magic that teachers do,"" added Pota.
""If we celebrate teachers, then it's more likely more people will want to do the job. I'd rather the world celebrate teachers more than (celebrate) Kim Kardashian,"" said Pota.",1

",The Ditch List: Is It To Cut These Three Struggling Running Backs,"The Ditch List: Is It To Cut These Three Struggling Running Backs
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Not every cut is created equal, and it’s going to depend on your league size/format in many cases. That said there have been some obviously disappointing starts to the season and in the right circumstance three weeks is enough information to formulate a decision, cut bait and move on. Let’s take a look at a few candidates that you should consider dropping:
Isaiah Crowell – Cleveland Browns – Running Back
Outright dropping him is going to be a tough sell, but using him is nearly impossible at this point. A week after the Jets’ were torched by Leonard Fournette for 145 yards and 1 TD, Crowell managed just 67 yards on 18 touches. Even more concerning is the fact that five games into the season this performance was his best. The 18 touches were the most he’s had since Week 1 and at this point anticipating something in the 10-14 touch range is realistic.
The Browns don’t seem inclined to give Duke Johnson many inside runs so Crowell will remain a consistent factor, but it’s simply not going to be enough touches for him to make a regular impact (it will be interesting to see if Matt Dayes gets a look at some point soon). Averaging 3.1 yards/carry (194 yards on 62 carries), stash Crowell on your bench just in case but he’s more of a desperation FLEX play for now.
Verdict – Stash him on your bench, but don’t start him
Frank Gore – Indianapolis Colts – Running Back
He’s been consistently underwhelming, with his 14 carries for 48 yards (3.4 yards/carry) yesterday being the latest. His lines have been saved by strong receiving days the past two weeks (6 catches for 72 yards), and being able to find the end zone the two weeks prior to that. Things should quickly change, though, as Marlon Mack returned from injury and quickly showed that he is the far more explosive runner (9 carries for 91 yards and 1 TD).
The question now is where does Indianapolis go from here? Will there be an even split? Do they trust Mack to emerge as the lead runner? We’ll have to wait and see, but we’d expect a nearly 50/50 split initially with the potential for it to shift further quickly. Gore is worth hanging onto, at least for now, but his time could quickly run out.
Verdict – Stash him just in case, but the risk outweighs the reward
Paul Perkins – New York Giants – Running Back
Perkins has been a bitter disappointment this season, averaging a meager 1.9 yards/carry on the season. In his absence both Orleans Darkwa and Wayne Gallman saw a heavy workload (though Darkwa, like many New York Giants, didn’t escape unscathed) and produced impressive lines:
Orelans Darkwa – 8 carries for 69 yards and 1 TD
Wayne Gallman – 11 carries for 57 yards
It’s impossible to think that, when healthy, Perkins will return to a starting role and depending on health could be slotted in third on the depth chart. If you need the roster spot, move on.
Verdict – Drop ‘Em

",Freedom Exists Under Natural Law,"By Rosanne Lindsay
To know freedom is to know Nature. Living in harmony with Nature leads to peace, prosperity, knowledge, truth, action, and freedom. Nature reflects the order of the universe. Living in opposition to Nature leads to war, control, ignorance, fear, stagnation, and enslavement.
Today, America, The Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, finds herself in shackles and homeless. The foundation of American freedom is cracked. New restrictive mandates form the walls of a prison cell which we have built through our own apathy and ignorance. The original Charters of Freedom: The United States Constitution, The Bill of Rights, and The Declaration of Independence were written to reflect Inherent Rights of the individual. Yet these documents are being ignored by the very government created to uphold them because, by themselves, they are only metaphorical shields.
Why are we losing freedom?
Because we have forgotten where our rights come from. Human rights are natural and inborn, granted by the Creator. They come from our humanity under the Laws of Nature. Natural Law and Justice is, and always has been, the primary fundamental force in the universe. It is a body of Universal Spiritual Laws which governs Consciousness. Consciousness creates through each of us using free will. We are consciousness.
We have stopped taking action to secure freedom. We thought that when we created government in America as a Constitutional Republic, individuals would be recognized to hold certain inalienable rights; rights which are not transferable and which can never be revoked, regardless of what the majority wants, or who holds power. However what we have agreed to is a Democracy.
A Republic is where the people control the government. A Democracy, is where the Government controls the people.
When Rights Are Legalized
Rights granted and legalized by governments are not rights at all. In fact, they are privileges that can be altered restricted, and taken away by legislation or Executive Orders.
These privileges are codified (codes) in legalese. Legalese is the language of statutes, which redefines words as tools to expand the scope and power of the State. Under statutes, a “person” is a legal fiction, not a human being with free will. At the same time, a “corporation” is defined as “a number of persons united in one body, so it can acquire wealth, expand, and enjoy other rights.” Note: a corporation is incapable of loyalty or love. Governments also regulate behavior through licensure. A license is permission to do something otherwise deemed to be illegal.
A government that gives itself power by its own authority is a rogue government and must be restrained, or else the trend is toward a concentration of power where laws are homogenized and standardized to one-opinion rule -a monarchy. Unless we can wake ourselves up, the United Nations (UN) International treaties (UNCRC), intend to “reduce inequality” by implementing new norms of global socialism and corporate fascism as part of their Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals.
What is Freedom?
To go to the next level in human evolution is to return more deeply into Nature. That is where freedom lives. Freedom is our ability to:
express without limits,
to seek truth and understanding,
to access the foods of our choice,
to choose what we allow into our bodies and our minds,
to grow our own foods and plant medicines,
to speak our truth,
to raise children without government interference,
to choose love instead of fear,
to choose healing over treatment,
to embody and integrate the Charters of Freedom,
to claim responsibility for individual choices, and the consequences of those choices.
How few of us have made our individual declaration of independence, and until we do that, we are not free.– Edwin Manners
The American Declaration of Independence reminds us,
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
When governments ignore the will of the people and “go rogue” for the benefit of the few at the expense of the many, it is time to remember from where true freedom comes. Our system derives from our free will and consent.
The Polarity Principle
There are two belief systems representing the polarity existing on Planet Earth. Under the Polarity Principle everything has poles or pairs of opposite charge:
One belief system says that a human being is separate from all others, designed to control others when they cannot or do not reason for themselves. This belief derives from man-made written codes that must be learned.
Another belief system says that each human is a cell of the collective web, and that all humans are connected as one entity, one interconnected humanity. This belief derives from Natural Law. Natural Law is not written, but intuitive and knowable by simple observation, reason, common sense, and deduction. ‘By your action, ye shall be known.’
On a free-will planet, everything is presented as an offer to contract and it is always up to each of us to consent or to withdraw consent. Silence is acquiescence. Ignorance of the law is no excuse in the Age of Information.
Legal Vs. Lawful
There is a difference between legal and lawful. Legal pertains to the letter of law, whereas lawful pertains to the spirit of law. Legal matters reflect statutes between government entities and the color of law (i.e., the appearance or semblance, without the substance), whereas lawful matters reflect common law, the law of the land—the law of the people—and are actual in nature, not implied. Going forward, if we are to be free, we must resist playing a game of wits in a corrupt system that seeks to destroy Inherent Rights.
Instead, we must take back the language and determine who we are. Are we a “person-corporation” or a soul embodied? Do we have free-will or do we ask for permission from an outside authority? Do we consent to the dictates of a rogue government or do we withdraw consent? Do we own our bodies or does the State? Do we recognize inalienable rights and act on them? Do we reclaim our sovereignty as free-will beings? It is time to redefine the words we live by to work in our favor.
The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad) True Freedom for all should be seen as the goal of Spiritual development. Such a state can only manifest as a result of human society’s adherence to Natural Law. – Mark Passio, Natural Law, the Real Law of Attraction
Follow Intuition
As part of nature, we must connect to Nature to experience freedom. As Within So Without. When we follow government dictates as truth, we lose touch with our own intuition. We lose connection with our true nature. As long as we remain distracted, debating the details of the system (war, mandates, rigged elections, the NFL, science, abortion, self-identification), we are directionless, lost in a maze of confusion. By consenting to a system of contradictions through our participation and acceptance, the system feeds off our energy.
If America is held up as an example of Freedom to the rest of the world, we must get our act together and identify with Natural Law. Through the power of our vision we become the architect of the life we want to create for ourselves and for our families. We only need to reclaim responsibility and act on it in order to see it emanate out to affect all life. Such is the Law of Nature.
In the American system no government is sovereign. The peoples of the states are the sovereigns. It is they who apportion powers between themselves, their state governments, and the federal government. In doing so they are not impairing their sovereignty in any way. To the contrary, they are exercising it.” – Tom Woods, Tenth Amendment Center

",U.S. still seeking explanation for arrest of staff in Turkey: ambassador,"U.S. Ambassador to Turkey John Bass speaks during a meeting with media members in Ankara, Tukey, October 11, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer
ANKARA (Reuters) - The United States is still seeking an explanation from Ankara for the detention of staff at U.S. missions in Turkey which led Washington to stop issuing visas and triggered a diplomatic crisis, the U.S. ambassador said on Wednesday.
Ambassador John Bass said the decision to suspend granting visas was not taken lightly, but the detentions indicated a breakdown in communication between the two NATO allies, whose relations have come under increasing strain.
“Unfortunately... the U.S. government still has not received any official communications from the Turkish government about the reasons why our local employees have been detained or arrested,” he told reporters at the U.S. embassy in Ankara.
Washington says two locally employed staff were arrested in Turkey this year. In May, a translator at the consulate in the southern province of Adana was arrested and last week a Drug Enforcement Administration worker was detained in Istanbul.
President Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman said last week the Istanbul employee, Metin Topuz, had been in contact with a leading suspect in last year’s failed military coup. Turkish media reported similar accusations against the translator.
“The notion that people in our employment are facing or are under suspicion of terrorism charges here, that is a very serious allegation,” Bass said. “It is one we want to take seriously and we want to better understand the ostensible evidence that supports these allegations”.
Since the failed military coup in July last year, in which at least 240 people were killed, more than 50,000 people have been detained and 150,000, including teachers, academics, soldiers and journalists, have been suspended from work.
Some Western allies fear the crackdown shows the country is slipping ever deeper into authoritarian rule under Erdogan.
Ankara says its critics fail to understand the scale of the security challenges in Turkey, which has also faced conflict on its southern borders with Iraq and Syria, and an insurgency in its mainly Kurdish southeast.

ENVOY TARGETED
Erdogan has blamed Bass for the latest dispute, suggesting he acted unilaterally in suspending visa services and declaring that his government no longer considered Bass to be Washington’s envoy and would not hold meetings with him.
The U.S. State Department denied Bass acted alone, saying his actions were coordinated with officials in Washington.
In a sign that Ankara was stepping back from the pledge to exclude Bass, Turkish television channels reported that he met a foreign ministry official later on Wednesday. The ambassador is due to leave Turkey within days to take up a post in Afghanistan.
U.S.-Turkish tensions have risen in recent months over U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey.
Turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the United States to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally of Erdogan who is viewed in Ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup.
Another source of friction was the U.S. indictment of Turkey’s former economy minister Zafer Caglayan for conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran. A U.S. court also indicted 15 of Erdogan’s guards after they clashed with protesters during his visit to Washington in May.
In addition to the two detained consulate workers, Turkey is holding a U.S. pastor on charges which Turkish media say include membership of Gulen’s network. Bass called for the release of the Christian missionary, Andrew Brunson, saying he had seen nothing of merit in the charges against him.
He denied reports that Turkish police were trying to speak to another consulate employee. “To the best of our knowledge there are not any outstanding requests from Turkish law enforcement officials for any of our local staff to come in and talk to them,” he said.",1

","‘In Spite of It All, America’","Since Germany’s as well as Europe’s security and affluence rest upon the current international order even as President Trump charts a different course for the United States, an increased responsibility falls to the European Union and its member state Germany to safeguard and strengthen the international order.
2. A president sui generis
It is impossible to ignore that President Trump was able to attract the support of 60 million voters. It is also true that unilateral foreign policy, protectionist moods, and periodic calls for “America first” policies have a long tradition in the United States. Still, Donald Trump is a president sui generis whose ideas about international order do not fit within the modern American politician tradition. These ideas are supported by few in the United States. His disdain for international alliances and institutions is not even shared by many in the government he leads, much less by those outside of government. Donald Trump’s positions on global order are outside the mainstream of the foreign policy expert community in the United States. It is unclear, maybe even unlikely, that his strategy of undermining the international order will ever succeed in the United States and become his country’s policy.
3. Dangerous consequences
Some analysts and political actors in Germany would like to draw far-reaching conclusions from this period of uncertainty about the direction of the United States. They endorse a strategic reorientation for Germany. Some strive to decouple Europe’s foreign and security policy from the United States. Others place their faith in a German-French mini version of Europe. Sometimes, European aspirations only disguise German nationalism as a response to American nationalism. Some recommend that Germany should focus on ad hoc coalitions or maintain equidistance between Russia and the United States. Some even recommend that Germany should go further, and align itself with Russia or China in the future.
All of these propositions are costly or dangerous — or both.
4. The United States remains indispensable
Turning away from the United States would bring insecurity to Germany and ultimately to Europe.
The bond with the United States was born from dependence, but it has long been in Germany’s core national interest. Today, no other actor in the world can offer the same advantages to Germany that it gains from its alliance with the United States. No other power takes on such far-reaching security guarantees and offers such comprehensive political resources.
As a liberal hegemon, the United States made European integration possible. The majority of the political establishment in the United States continues to see the country as a supporter of European integration — also because it suits its own interest. The country needs allies that share its values and interests.
If Germany wants to be an effective actor in Europe, it needs the United States. If the ties to the United States are cut, with them go the reassurance that other European countries need in order to accept a strong Germany in the center of the continent. The more leadership that Germany can and should take on, the closer the coordination must be with the United States.

Decoupling from the United States would fundamentally question one of the most important political and cultural achievements of the past 70 years: Germany’s integration in the West.
In aligning itself with the West, Germany also committed itself to the values of freedom and democracy, and to cooperation with all those who stand for these values. Freedom is the precondition for human beings to lead a self-determined and dignified live. Germany has committed itself to this set of ideas in its constitution, the Basic Law. Its anchoring in the West gave Germany the steadfastness to resist the Communist regimes and make possible German and European reunification. A departure from this trans-Atlantic orientation will renew the threat of a special path (Sonderweg) of Germany, it will strengthen nationalists on the left and the right, and it will endanger the peaceful European order.
The West, even today, does not exist without the United States, neither as a concept, nor as a political subject. America is the anchor of liberal universalism and the open world order. Even if Donald Trump’s presidency carries significant risks for the liberal order, these perils will not diminish if Germany puts its strategic partnership with the United States at stake. A strategic decoupling from the United States would ultimately endanger the liberal international order more than prudent cooperation with a United States whose leadership currently rattles this order. Autocracies such as China and Russia can be important ad hoc partners for single projects; the United States, however, must remain the strategic partner for a democratic and European Germany.
The relationship with the United States is a values-based partnership built on our democratic political systems. Even if the current United States president challenges significant elements of the political system, the United States remains a democracy. President Trump is not America, nor is the illiberal movement for which he stands a solely American phenomenon. In Europe, too, it has made its mark. What we see today is not a divergence between Europe and the United States; it is a conflict within the West unfolding on both sides of the Atlantic.
Finally, the economic, scientific and cultural linkages with the United States are far stronger than with any other region in the world. The interplay with the United States remains a central element of Europe’s capacity for innovation.
5. Yet, no business as usual
So, how do we engage with the United States in times of Donald Trump?
Even if turning away from the United States is not a responsible option for Germany, business as usual is not an option with the current presidency either. It would be equally unhelpful to stay silent and look the other way, waiting until this presidency is finally over and a successor occupies the White House. Four or even eight years is too long to sit it out, especially since there will not be a return to the supposed good old times.
6. Ideas for a new U.S. Strategy
German policy now requires something that it did not need before: a United States strategy.
A responsible policy toward the United States must be long-term and build a bridge into the post-Trump age. This policy must look beyond an exceptional period of American skepticism toward any multilateral commitment. However, Germany must not fall prey to the illusion that there will be a return to the status quo ante following the Trump presidency. Several political trends in the United States will outlive Trump’s time in office — for example, the demand for more balanced burden-sharing between Europe and the United States within NATO. However, the end of the Trump presidency should be the end of the inner Western conflict about the fundamentals of the world order. Once this fundamental consensus is re-established, policy disagreements can be resolved or bridged more easily and more constructively.

This long-term goal must be the point of reference for Germany’s short-term engagement with the Trump administration.
In the short term, Germany must learn to distinguish between the problems that are solvable, those that are unsolvable and those in between that require pragmatic management.
It goes without saying that the German government should double down on those policy areas where it finds common ground with the current United States administration. But successful relationship management in times of Donald Trump may also require adjusting an increasingly untenable position or — vice versa — to enter into a limited conflict. Finally, we will need to look for partners not only at the highest federal levels, but elsewhere in the administration, in the United States Congress, in the states, in civil society and in business.

It will be more important than ever to manage differences responsibly. In its own long-term interest, Germany should attempt to handle these differences with the Trump administration in such a way that does not escalate them or allow them to spiral out of control.
Germany should not succumb to illusions: Large-scale joint projects with the Trump administration will have little chance for success in policy areas that are central to President Trump’s populist agenda. Trying to do too much in these key policy areas will only cause new disagreements.
In short, Germany’s United States strategy must allow for multitasking: to actively pursue key national interests in collaboration with the United States, to moderate conflicts, to avoid unrealistic ambitions and to thus build a bridge to a better future for trans-Atlantic relations.
This nuanced approach will have different consequences for the different policy areas.
7. Trade policy — aim only for conflict management
Soberingly, the signs are not favorable for larger projects in several policy areas that would actually be vital, such as trade policy. Despite all controversies, the strategic and economic reasons for a trans-Atlantic free trade agreement (TTIP) have not disappeared since November 2016. Some in Berlin and Brussels hope that one can resurrect TTIP in an adapted version. This idea is illusory, maybe even dangerous. A president who castigates all free-trade agreements as unfair toward the United States will not easily compromise in international negotiations. A negotiating failure will be more devastating to the project than a long hibernation.

There are signs already that the United States and the European Union might be headed toward trade disputes. The European Union must react to punitive tariffs. But it should do so exclusively in a legal, proportional and symmetrical manner. Everything else could trigger an unwanted escalation.
8. International refugee policy — no chance for a joint vision
Joint initiatives regarding international refugee policy do not look very promising either. The global system of protection, however, urgently needs to be reformed to cope with modern conditions. The rights of refugees need to be protected, while illegal migration needs to be curtailed and organized trafficking should be combated so that the universal refugee system is not undermined. Equally important will be a push toward new and improved United Nations’ resettlement programs. However, it appears difficult to imagine that the Trump administration will agree to such initiatives. Consequently, Europe must become active itself here — as best as it can.
Therefore, trade and refugee policies fall in the category of currently difficult, hardly resolvable issues. The best we can expect is limited progress, but no large-scale initiatives.
9. Security policy — strive for progress, also with President Trump
Security policy is a different matter. Without the United States there will be no security for and in Germany for the foreseeable future. This applies to territorial as well as alliance defense within NATO, but also to nuclear deterrence, to combating cybercrimes and money laundering, and finally to counterterrorism and the cooperation of intelligence agencies. No single European country, nor Germany, nor any other country nor the European Union can provide the necessary resources to guarantee the continent’s security. Therefore, the existing cooperation must be strengthened. Remaining committed to NATO also provides a way to integrate the United States into the structures of multilateral security policy and may dissuade Washington from going it alone.
Alliance defense is the most cost-effective form of defense. Germany should thus take seriously the call for fairer burden-sharing within the alliance. Acting against its own core interest, Germany has not done enough in this respect. Germany still has a long way to go until its NATO goals and commitments are met. To be clear: Germany agreed to increase its defense expenditures toward 2 percent of its gross domestic product. Germany should keep its word. To present this commitment as a threat to the military balance in European is to get it backward. It is precisely our European neighbors and partners that are asking for more German commitment within the NATO framework and within European defense policy.
It would be even better if Germany were to invest an extra percentage point of G.D.P. into development assistance, international police operations, United Nations missions, conflict prevention and diplomacy. With this linkage, nonmilitary aspects of security would also be upgraded. This would substantially strengthen European defense capabilities within the trans-Atlantic alliance. Germany would do something that is in its own interest and would stabilize the trans-Atlantic alliance at the same time. It would address concerns of the Trump administration and build good will for the time after Donald Trump. The chances of success for this strategy are high: Despite all of the skeptical rhetoric about NATO, the Trump administration has fulfilled America’s NATO commitments so far.
Security policy cooperation with the Trump government should be central to Germany and should also include security guarantees for the central and eastern European NATO members, support for an independent Ukraine, as well as the stabilization of the North African coast.
In the conflict over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and the uncertainties around future Iran policy, a trans-Atlantic schism should be avoided. We should do whatever possible to convince the Trump administration of joint approaches.

10. Energy security policy — giving up Nord Stream 2 is in Germany’s interest
There is one more policy area in which the German government should reconsider its position to open the door for productive cooperation: energy security policy. The United States has identified Nord Stream 2, the planned pipeline running through the Baltic Sea to Russia, as a geostrategic project. They are correct. More important: This pipeline project is not in the joint European interest. Nord Stream 2 contradicts a policy of greater energy independence and undermines the envisaged European Energy Union. We should try to identify a joint approach with our European partners and the United States.
11. Climate, energy and digital policy — manage conflicts responsibly
After addressing the solvable issues and set aside the unsolvable issues for now, one will need to turn to those policy areas that require responsible conflict management. It would be useless to try to convince the United States administration of the importance of the Paris climate agreement, but it is equally wrongheaded to isolate President Trump on international climate and energy policy. Necessary criticism should not turn into dogmatism.
Instead, Germany should seek concrete steps forward in climate protection together with the United States. Germany does not need President Trump in order to engage with partners who are interested in climate policy cooperation. A number of states (not just California) and large cities are already rapidly reducing their CO 2 emissions. Political, scientific and technical cooperation with local partners is possible. There is no shortage of potent allies on climate policy in the United States, in the private sector as well as in civil society. Here, the key is to be proactive, to invest money and to build networks that will endure and outlast the Trump administration.
Digital policy is another policy area where confrontation is possible — about regulatory questions as well as about market shares. It is important to identify points of contention as soon as possible and to avoid unnecessary escalation. Sealing off Europe’s and the United States’ digital markets from each other will seriously damage the outlook for jobs and growth on both sides of the Atlantic. European consumer and data protection standards might be able to be maintained globally if they have United States support, but certainly not without it.
12. Final point — more Europe within the Alliance
Making progress with the Trump administration wherever possible, moderating conflicts and avoiding escalation, expanding the spectrum of trans-Atlantic partners beyond the current United States administration — these are all core aims of a United States strategy that can preserve the trans-Atlantic partnership with and if necessary against this American president, and function beyond his time in office. The United States has proved its capacity for self-correction repeatedly. America remains the indispensable power for those countries that stand for freedom and democracy and strive for an open world order. But Europe — and thus Germany — must do more to support and preserve these values. More European self-reliance is imperative. It would be an error of historical proportions to play out “more Europe” against the trans-Atlantic alliance. The new German government’s foreign policy will be measured by how clearly it pursues this course.

",Sir Ian McKellen says King Lear is his 'last big Shakespeare part',"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sir Ian McKellen: 'That's it, isn't it'
Ian McKellen has said his King Lear, which is currently on at Chichester Festival Theatre, is probably his last big Shakespeare part.
Interviewing him for BBC Two's Front Row, I asked him if he would ever act in Shakespeare again. He replied: ""Well, I think probably not really.""
The revelation came with several caveats: if the right part were offered, he would certainly consider it; he wants to continue playing other roles on stage; and he clearly fancies a go at Mercutio, but joked that Derek Jacobi's performance as the friend of Romeo in Romeo and Juliet made it hard to surpass.
There were times, sitting in Sir Ian's garden in Chichester, when he seemed to be still working out the next steps in his career, while reflecting on six decades of acting.
Image copyright Manuel Harlan Image caption Sir Ian as Lear
I remember seeing him and Patrick Stewart on the opening night of Waiting for Godot on Broadway, a play whose absence of plot creates the space for existential angst. So long and pregnant were the pauses before Sir Ian's answers in our chat, that we could have called it Waiting for Sir Ian. And yet when the answers came, they were always fascinating.
He said he often found it useful to imagine Shakespeare was alive and wandering around the rehearsal, and that his advice to young actors who wanted to have a career as varied and fun as his was to always choose the part that improved them as an actor. That, he said with what seemed like genuine humility, was partly why he'd chosen this part: it would improve him as an actor.
'Most unforgiving tragedy'
He was clearly frustrated with aspects of his performance as Lear in Trevor Nunn's version for the RSC a decade ago. Above all, having to perform it in vast theatres meant he declaimed lines that should have been more softly spoken, or even whispered.
There is irony aplenty in this. In his celebrated essay on Lear, AC Bradley said it was ""too huge for the stage"", and yet it is in the much smaller and more intimate setting of Chichester's Minerva Theatre, with around 280 seats wrapping around the stage, that Sir Ian feels he is able to convey the sweeping and universal themes of this, Shakespeare's most unforgiving tragedy.
What makes it so? Years ago, as an undergraduate, my friends and I entertained a theory that was nicked from G Wilson Knight's remarkable essay on Lear and the Comedy of the Grotesque. This essay was dedicated to the point that Angela Carter made when she said comedy is tragedy that happens to other people. In other words, a twist in perspective can give tragic action a comic aspect - and vice versa.
Image copyright Manuel Harlan Image caption Phil Daniels, left, stars as the Fool in the production
Throughout this production of Lear, as with so many productions, there is awkward, almost inappropriate laughter in the audience, whether at funny characters (the Fool), funny lines or funny devices - the scene at Dover is essentially a game of blind man's buff.
But in Lear the comic resolution never comes, and the plot offers no forgiveness - which is why, incidentally, Nahum Tate's 1681 revision of Lear in which Edgar marries Cordelia, is ludicrous.
Director Jonathan Munby's production thankfully honours Shakespeare's original intention. My only quibble with an otherwise outstanding show is that, on the night I saw it at least, one of Edmund's soliloquies suffered the unkindest cut.
His declaration that ""this is the excellent foppery of the world…"", which culminates in my favourite line from all Shakespeare, which should be inscribed on the memory of all atheists - ""an admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star"" - was horribly truncated.
Closer to Lear's age
But Damien Molony, who is superb alongside Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the Channel 4 comedy Crashing, is such a brilliant Edmund that he can be forgiven.
Lear has been played by so many of the great actors. I'd have given my little finger to see Nigel Hawthorne in the role.
Sir Ian, who millions will know only as Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings, does now inhabit a tradition going back to Olivier and Gielgud, but touchingly it was Richard Burbage, the actor who was Shakespeare's contemporary, that he seemed most keen to emulate.
At 78, he is now much closer to Lear's probable age than when he played the part for Nunn; and that has helped him to achieve what he told me was his aim: not to act Lear, but to be Lear.
Sir Ian's age may deprive new audiences of the chance to see him do Shakespeare. For those lucky few who have seen what some critics are hailing as one of the great productions of Lear, being 78 has given Sir Ian a plausibility that even he didn't have before.
By the end, Lear has lost a kingdom but gained something like enlightenment. I don't think it's a stretch to say that, sitting in his garden in Chichester, Sir Ian gave the impression of being an actor who has seen the light. Content with how this role is going, but desperate to keep learning, he is - like Gandalf - at the height of his powers.
I hope someone offers him Mercutio, quick.

British tennis star Dan Evans has been banned from competition for one year following a positive drug test for cocaine. Evans is currently the number 4 ranked British player. Evans will be allowed to return to competition April 24, 2018. The Guardian reports, The 27-year-old tested positive for cocaine during the Barcelona Open in April this year but the ITF said in a statement it accepted “inadvertent contamination” was to blame for the positive test and that Evans bore “no significant fault or negligence”. Evans, however, admitted to using cocaine when he was not competing four days before the test was taken. He claimed to have put a small amount of “leftover cocaine” first in his trouser pocket then in his washbag before discarding it the next day. Evans, who was world No50 before his positive test, has also had to give back the £92,205 of prize money won and the ranking points gained between the date of his test and the announcement of the positive finding on 23 June.

",Ceasefire deal sealed for rebel pocket near Damascus,"CAIRO/BEIRUT (Reuters) - A ceasefire deal for a Syrian rebel enclave south of Damascus was reached on Thursday, brokered by Cairo and Moscow, Egyptian state media said.
The agreement, which includes the Jaish al-Islam rebel faction, went into effect at midday on Thursday (1000 GMT), Egyptian state television said.
“We announced a preliminary agreement over the will to enter into a ceasefire and de-escalation deal for the area,” Jaish al-Islam political leader Mohammad Alloush said in televised comments. Details would be worked out in the near future, he said.
The announcement did not name the exact area or towns covered by the ceasefire, and did not mention the Syrian government. There was no immediate comment from Damascus.
Rebel factions hold a small pocket of territory south of Damascus, bordered to the west by an Islamic State enclave and surrounded from the other sides by Syrian troops and allied forces.
Backed by Russia, Iran and Shi‘ite militias, the Syrian government has pushed back rebels over the past year, shoring up its rule over the main urban centers.
Through a series of military offensives and evacuation deals, the government has snuffed out several opposition pockets around the Syrian capital of Damascus.
Thousands of rebels and civilians have poured into the insurgent-held Idlib province in northwest Syria, transferred out of towns and cities that the Syrian army retook.
In recent months, a string of ceasefire deals has eased some of the fighting between government forces and rebels in western Syria, including a truce in the southwest brokered by Russia and the United States.",1

",China says it has right to bar people from Hong Kong after British activist expelled,"HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Thursday it had the right to bar people from Hong Kong, a day after a British activist was denied entry to the former British colony, and that it had complained to Britain after it demanded an explanation.
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that promises it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.
But critics have accused the government of bending to the will of Communist Party leaders in Beijing and of a gradual watering down of the territory’s freedoms, including freedom of speech and right to protest.
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was “very concerned” that Benedict Rogers, a co-founder of the Conservative Party’s Human Rights Commission, was denied entry to Hong Kong on Wednesday and demanded an “urgent explanation” from Hong Kong and China.
It came a week before a sensitive Communist Party leadership meeting starts in Beijing.
Johnson also said Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms were “central to its way of life”.
Rogers has been a vocal critic of China-ruled Hong Kong’s treatment of political activists, including that of jailed student leader Joshua Wong. He believes the decision to bar him was made by Chinese officials after the Chinese Embassy in London had warned him earlier, through a British member of parliament, that he wouldn’t be allowed in.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the central government had a responsibility for foreign matters related to Hong Kong.
“The central Chinese government and the special administrative region government handle the relevant issue in accordance with the law,” Hua said. “Allowing or not allowing people in is China’s sovereignty ... Hong Kong affairs are a purely internal matter for China.”
She said China had lodged a solemn representation with Britain, meaning an official complaint.
When asked about the incident on a radio talk show, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam agreed.
“Ultimately, under the Basic Law (Hong Kong’s mini-constitution), the central government is responsible for foreign affairs,” Lam said.
Asked if immigration controls fell under Hong Kong jurisdiction, Lam said: ”It has to be considered whether foreign affairs are involved during the process of immigration.
“If you say everything falls under Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, this is not what the Basic Law says.”
Rogers, speaking to Reuters shortly after arriving in London, said Beijing’s statement confirmed his assumption that the decision to boot him out was made not by Hong Kong but by Chinese authorities.
He described the interference in Hong Kong’s immigration controls as “very alarming” and “a very serious threat to ‘one country, two systems’.”
“China has now revealed its hand. The world ought to have woken up a long time ago, but I think now they really ought to wake up to what this means for ‘one country, two systems’,” he said.
“I‘m very sad for what this means for Hong Kong.”
The former head of Hong Kong’s civil service turned pro-democracy activist, Anson Chan, said the case was a “serious breach” of the Basic Law.
Article 154 of the Basic Law says Hong Kong “may apply immigration controls on entry” of foreigners into Hong Kong.
“The Immigration Department must have sought instructions from on high,” she told Reuters. “They (Beijing) are sending a message that if you dare speak out on Hong Kong ... you will not be allowed in.”
Amnesty International’s East Asia director, Nicholas Bequelin, suggested China’s definition of what constitutes national security is creeping into Hong Kong.
“In China if you’re critical of the political system, you’re committing a national security crime and this is exactly the type of thing ‘one country, two systems’ should protect against.”
In response to a Reuters’ request for comment on whether China was involved in Rogers’ denial of entry, Hong Kong’s Immigration Department said it did not comment on individual cases.
China has admitted asking a group of British MPs to cancel a visit to Hong Kong in 2014 during the massive pro-democracy protests, of which Joshua Wong was a leader, that paralyzed highways for 79 days.
Hong Kong has, on occasion, barred entry to individuals including dissidents, such as former leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing and a Danish sculptor, Jens Galschiot, who made a Tiananmen sculpture.",1

",Fundamental And Constitutional Rights Negated In The Realm of Totalitarian Corporatocracy,"By Catherine J. Frompovich
Why are U.S. citizens being subjected to inhuman violations of their fundamental and Constitutional rights by vested corporate interests, and no one in Congress, or in the practice of law or the judicial system, is doing anything to correct and to restore basic unalienable human fundamental rights?
Two specific areas of modern commerce present overwhelming examples of gross human rights violations:
The pharmaceutical industry with its “consensus vaccine science,” which inaccurately promotes and provides neurotoxic vaccines as ‘safe and effective’ that mandatorily must be inoculated into infants within 24 hours of birth and at 2, 4 and 6 months of age when their immune systems and blood brain barriers are not fully developed, thereby predisposing unknown adverse health risks for which numerous innocent children will be ‘sacrificed for the greater good, i.e., ‘community immunity’, with ensuing lifelong harms—or possibly even death—as evidenced by the CDC’s VAERS reporting system and HRSA Vaccine VICP Claims Adjudications [1]; and The microwave industry and its acolyte ‘subsidiary-like industries’, e.g., public utilities, which utilize microwaves to provide electric, natural gas and water utilities metering services despite the plethora of scientific documentation regarding EMF/RF/ELF non-thermal radiation waves impairing and damaging DNA, cellular mitochondria and central nervous systems thereby subjecting customers/consumers to short- and long-term adverse health effects known as electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) or medically as idiopathic environmental intolerance (IEI), including chronic diseases.
As an information researcher and journalist, I’ve thought about how the above problems have been contradictory to the primary law of the land, the U.S. Constitution, especially when, and since, corporations have overtaken Congress and basically write new laws to promote or protect their vested, financial and controlling interests thereby implementing a new form of governance, a “Corporatocracy.”
Corporate lobbyists and the revolving door policy between corporations and government are now the norm. Monsanto’s chief lobbyist, Michael Taylor, as Deputy Commissioner at the FDA and Monsanto’s corporate lawyer, Clarence Thomas, sitting on the U.S. Supreme Court bench since 1991 as an Associate Justice, are perfect examples.
There has to be some way to effectuate enforcing and/or taking back basic human rights in the USA. I did some research online and found a thought-provoking and attention-grabbing write up about a case that just may drive home legal points regarding our being
a. forced to eat genetically modified food without proper identification and labeling; b. forced to drink fluoridated water, a protoplasmic poison which decreases IQ; c. forced to subscribe to allopathic healthcare without standard health insurance coverage to provide for holistic health services and modalities being covered thereby creating a medical monopoly for a failing allopathic health system; d. forced to get vaccines or not be able to go to school, work or partake in other activities; e. forced to be EMF-radiated 24/7/365 with non-thermal RF waves from AMI Smart Meters or have no electric, natural gas or water utilities; and f. forced to breathe weather geoengineering chemtrails chemicals, nanoparticulates and other unknown experimental technologies (Morgellons?) and to live in fear of catastrophic weather patterns being created by the military, who plans on owning the weather by 2025 (“Weather a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather by 2025” (4)), and other vested interests.
I’m certain there are numerous other grievances readers can remind me about, but I use the above as examples for this article.
After doing online research regarding ownership of one’s “bodily integrity,” I came across a JD candidate’s paper written by Stephanie Weiler in May of 1998 for her law degree from California Western School of Law. The paper is titled “Bodily Integrity: A Substantive Due Process Right to Be Free from Rape by Public Officials” published in the California Western Law Review, Volume 34, 1998, with this notice:
This Comment is brought to you for free and open access by CWSL Scholarly Commons.

Available at: http://scholarlycommons.law.cwsl.edu/cwlr/vol34/iss2/19
Since the article is “free and open access by CWSL Scholarly Commons,” I will not be violating any of the author’s or copyright regulations in citing what Stephanie Weiler so brilliantly pointed out and argued.
However, I definitely want my readers to substitute all the issues aforementioned above [1, 2, a. thru f.] for “RAPE” in order to understand the position I take and make regarding our basic human rights, which are being violated similarly to being ‘raped’ figuratively, considering various alliterations of that terminology being applied as analogies in this article.
The rape case being discussed in Weiler’s paper was cited as
… depriving a person of constitutional rights in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. §242.1 18 U.S.C. § 242 provides that “[w]hoever, under color of any law …. willfully subjects any person in any State, … to the deprivation of any rights, … secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States, … on account of such person being an alien, or by reason of his color or race …. shall be fined … or imprisoned … or both.
Weiler stated in her paper, “Substantive Due Process is the constitutional guaranty that no person can be arbitrarily deprived of his life, liberty, or property. Specifically, substantive due process provides protection from arbitrary and unreasonable action by government actors.” Babineaux v. Judiciary Commission, 341 So. 2d 396, 400 (La. 1976).
So what is “Substantive Due Process”? According to Wikipedia,
Substantive due process, in United States constitutional law, is a principle allowing courts to protect certain fundamental rights from government interference, even if procedural protections are present or the rights are not specifically mentioned elsewhere in the US Constitution. Courts have identified the basis for such protection from the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution, which prohibit the federal and state governments, respectively, from depriving any person of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Substantive due process demarcates the line between the acts that courts hold are subject to government regulation or legislation and the acts that courts place beyond the reach of governmental interference. Whether the Fifth and/or Fourteenth Amendments were intended to serve that function continues to be a matter of scholarly as well as judicial discussion and dissent. [….] Much substantive due process litigation involves legal challenges about unenumerated rights that seek particular outcomes instead of merely contesting procedures and their effects. In successful cases, the Supreme Court recognizes a constitutionally based liberty that considers laws that seek to limit that liberty to be unenforceable or limited in scope.[4] Critics of substantive due process decisions usually assert that there is no textual basis in the Constitution for such protection and that such liberties should be left under the purview of the more politically accountable branches of government. Source
Weiler wrote,
The liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “is not a series of points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press and religion; … and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial and arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints .” [CJF emphasis] Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 543 (1961). [….] Over the years, courts have used the liberty guaranteed by the due process clause to protect various invasions on bodily integrity. A brief overview of the cases in which courts have applied the right to bodily integrity to areas of personal autonomy and family decisions… The Supreme Court recognized and protected the substantive due process right to bodily integrity in Rochin v. People of California.52 [Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (1952).] In Rochin, the Court held that sheriffs violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when they forced defendant to turn over evidence by forcibly inducing him to vomit. 53 Justice Frankfurter explained, forcing defendant to vomit did “more than offend some fastidious squeamishness or private sentimentalism about combating crime too energetically. This is conduct that shocks the conscience.”‘ This action was “bound to offend even hardened sensibilities. [It was] too close to the rack and the screw to permit of [sic] constitutional differentiation. Faced with an even more egregious violation of bodily integrity, the Supreme Court invalidated a Connecticut statute imposing fines or imprisonment for “any person who uses any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception.” Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479,480 (1965)
Question: Wasn’t that very issue, “preventing conception,” in a vaccine’s ingredient given to young child-bearing-age women [2] alleged and pursued by the Catholic bishops in Nairobi, Kenya, Africa?
Furthermore, Weiler went on to say,
… finding that “specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras [The rights guaranteed by implication in a constitution or the implied powers of a rule. Free Legal Dictionary] formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance. Various guarantees create zones of privacy.” [CJF emphasis] [CJF: In homes, privacy zones are taken away or eliminated by the two-way surveillance-monitoring ZigBee radio transmitters in AMI Smart Meters utilities use to collect and to sell customers’ usage and other data to unknown third parties without customers’ consent and/or knowledge. (3)] In an entirely different context, the Supreme Court upheld a person’s right “generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.” Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 673 (1977) (quoting Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923)). [CJF: Happiness for free men and women does not mean being subjected to debilitating microwave RF radiation causing EHS/IEI or even long-range diseases, e.g., cancer, as documented by research science (5).]
Weiler, in her paper, points out these important criteria:
In Ingraham, the Court reasoned that “[a]mong the historic liberties so protected was a right to be free from, and to obtain judicial relief, for unjustified intrusions on personal security .” 61. Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 673 (1977) (quoting Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923)). [CJF emphasis] [AMI Smart Meters certainly are intrusions on personal security, especially with their vulnerability to being hacked since, basically, they are “computers” that will have to be replaced every 5 or 6 years with customers paying for those new, updated meters.] The Supreme Court has also applied the right to bodily integrity to cases where the patient chooses to forego medical treatment. In Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health, the Court held that the Constitution does not forbid Missouri from requiring clear and convincing evidence66 of an incompetent person’s wishes to be withdrawn from life sustaining treatment.’ The Court explained that the “notion of bodily integrity has been embodied in the requirement that informed consent is generally required for medical treatment .” 67. [CJF emphasis] Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261,282 (1990). [CJF: Informed consent is not requested nor even desired with regard to mandatory vaccinations; vaccinations will be given under great duress as per https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/15/2016-18103/control-of-communicable-diseases#h-32 .]
Here’s what I don’t understand with regard to the CDC’s “control of communicable diseases” mandate it assumed as requested (and obtained) in the above document, and U.S. government agencies (CDC/FDA) not abiding by U.S. Supreme Court case law:
In Cruzan, Justice Rehnquist referred to Cardozo’s early definition of bodily integrity, stating that, “[ elvery [sic] human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body .” Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261,282 (1990). Id. (quoting Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hosp., 105 N.E. 92, 93 (N.Y. 1914)). [CJF emphasis—what don’t they get or want to get? Are we all ‘pawns’ in the push toward transhumanism (6)?]
In my opinion, here’s what all this really boils down to legally about bodily integrity and, as Weiler so eloquently argues in her paper:
As evidenced throughout the common law evolution of bodily integrity, the courts rely on the substantive due process right to privacy or bodily integrity whenever the government impinges upon a person’s autonomy over his or her body. The progression of bodily integrity in the courts confirms that the Supreme Court recognizes and protects people from governmental invasions on personal security. [CJF emphasis] [CJF: Why is THAT legal principal not being factored into corporate memes that want dominant controls over everyone’s life, plus holding corporations accountable legally?] In fact, the Court found that a competent person has the right to refuse life saving nutrition and hydration.94 Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261,282 (1990).
In the rape case being discussed in Weiler’s excellently thought out paper, women’s rights were at the forefront. Weiler said,
Forced sex violates a woman’s right to bodily integrity in the same ways restrictive abortion legislation violates bodily integrity. [CJF: Can we substitute the following terms for “forced sex”: Forced vaccinations; forced non-thermal RF microwave radiation waves from AMI Smart Meters, cell phones, cell and mast towers and 5G Wi-Fi in the sky, despite no human safety studies ever performed?] The right to bodily integrity is the essence of the constitutional right to privacy, as the Supreme Court recognized in Griswold, Cruzan, and Casey. [CJF emphasis] [CJF: What has happened that corporations and government agencies aren’t made to abide by and accountable for depriving consumers of one of the ‘gold standards’ of the U.S. legal system: case law enforcement of bodily integrity rights?] The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad) However, both the state and federal rape laws fail to provide victims of rape with an adequate remedy.’ [CJF: The same remedy failures now apply to state and federal laws failing to provide protection at law regarding electromagnetic frequencies, e.g., EMFs/RFs/ELFs, which must be addressed responsibly and ethically (certainly not by vested interest consensus science and their professional associations, i.e., ICNIRP) by the U.S. Federal Communication Commission and the Courts, especially SCOTUS.] Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (“VAWA”).” 8 The VAWA provides the first civil rights remedy to victims of gender motivated violence.”9 The VAWA provides, in pertinent part: [a] person… who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender and thus deprives another of the right declared in subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to the party injured, in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and other such relief as the court may deem appropriate.’ 42 U.S.C. § 13981(c). [CJF: Where’s an act of Congress providing civil rights remedies and protections to victims of EMFs/RFs/ELFs microwave crimes against human health and the environment? What’s the legal difference between a woman being raped and an individual being made sick purposefully by government mandates or illegal laws? Both victims experience physical, mental and emotional damage, especially and ironically, since no human health studies have been performed to prove human safety for EMFs/RFs/ELFs. Microwave ‘safety science’ notoriously comes from World War II ‘vintage’ pontifications regarding only ‘heat safety’. Thirty-two percent of microwave industry-funded studies prove non-thermal radiation wave adverse effects, yet that industry and its professional association ICNIRP adamantly refuse to acknowledge such harms exist from microwave technologies. Shouldn’t that be a prosecutable crime of concealment and collusion under the RICO Act 18 U.S.C. ch. 96 as 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968 (7)?] Equal Rights Amendment of the 1970s. It [will] include the right to freedom of bodily integrity of [one’s] person.”‘ [CJF: Shouldn’t everyone in the USA have the right to freedom of bodily integrity from being forced to eat GMOs without proper identification on food packaging; vaccines should not be forced but voluntary for those who want them, thereby not denying individuals of their right to bodily integrity by being injected by neurotoxins and hazmat materials; not be forced to suffer from EMFs/RFs emitted by AMI Smart Meters, Wi-Fi and various generations of Wi-Fi including the new ‘hot button’ 5G, which have never been tested for human health adverse effects?]
What’s wrong with the U.S. legal system?
My many thanks to Stephanie Weiler for an exceptionally well-written paper regarding bodily integrity.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A district court in Fukushima prefecture on Tuesday ruled that Tokyo Electric Power and the Japanese government were liable for damages totaling about 500 million yen ($4.44 million) in the largest class action lawsuit brought over the 2011 nuclear disaster, Kyodo news agency said.
A group of about 3,800 people, mostly in Fukushima prefecture, filed the class action suit, marking the biggest number of plaintiffs out of about 30 similar class action lawsuits filed across the nation.
This is the second court ruling that fixed the government’s responsibility after a Maebashi district court decision in March.
All the three district court decisions so far have ordered Tepco to pay damages. Only the Chiba court decision last month did not find the government liable for compensation.
The plaintiffs in Fukushima case have called on defendants for reinstating the levels of radioactivity at their homes before the disaster, but the court rejected the request, Kyodo said.
Tepco has long been criticized for ignoring the threat posed by natural disasters to the Fukushima plant and the company and the government were lambasted for their handling of the crisis.",1

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court on Thursday overturned the conviction of a dentist couple for the murder of their teenage daughter and the family servant for lack of material evidence, their lawyer said.
Aarushi Talwar was found with her throat slit at the family home in the Delhi suburb of Noida in 2008. A day later, the body of the servant, Hemraj, was found on the roof of the house.
A trial court convicted the girl’s parents, Rajesh and Nupur Talwar, after police alleged Rajesh had murdered his daughter and the servant in a rage when he found them in a compromising situation. The couple, both dentists, were jailed for life.
But a high court overruled the decision saying it was not satisfied with the evidence and ordered the couple be freed, their lawyer Tanveer Ahmed Mir said.
“The court found no forensic or material evidence to prove that the Talwars had killed their daughter,” Mir told reporters outside a packed courtroom in the northern city of Allahabad.
Both parents had denied the murder and insisted they were victims of botched investigations and unfair media coverage, damaging their defense.
Aarushi’s case was labeled as a kind of crime more often associated with rural, conservative parts of India where “honor killings” are not uncommon.
Every twist in the investigation was extensively reported by the Indian press, turning the Talwars into household names.
“Finally my family can lead a dignified life. The court has upheld the facts and truth,” said Rajesh Talwar’s sister, Vandana, after the decision.
In 2015, a journalist who covered the murder wrote a book arguing that the couple were innocent. The double murder case and faulty probe were used as a theme for a Bollywood movie the same year.",1

(Before It's News)
This week has seen London play host to the bids of France, South Africa and Ireland to stage the 2023 Rugby World Cup, with the respective bidding teams displaying their respective wares in front of World Rugby.
With France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, deciding that he couldn’t be arsed to attend the presentation or endorse the French bid, France’s bidding team turned to an ingenious (although somewhat bizarre) Plan B by choosing to parade the young sons of New Zealand rugby legend, Jonah Lomu as part of the bid. Jonah quite liked France, apparently. Which is nice.
South Africa’s strategy, meanwhile, appeared to be based on the fact that they once hosted the Rugby World Cup well over 20 years ago when that very nice, smiley man Nelson Mandela was President. No mention, surprisingly, that for financial reasons South Africa had recently decided against bidding to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games.
And as for the Irish, apparently if Ireland wins the bid to host the World Cup in 2023 it will somehow (and I kid you not) make rugby incredibly popular in the United States of America. Call me naive, but wouldn’t hosting the event in the USA be more likely to do that?
Go figure, and while you’re doing that please bear in mind that the Irish bid has also won the backing of UK Prime Minister Theresa May. What could possibly go wrong?

Look, plain and simple I am over this “Take a knee” bullshit in my opinion.
Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports
I’m not writing to debate with anyone on this. Everyone has a right to their own opinion and to protest….I get it. But I also have a right to turn on my television and watch America’s favorite pastime without the extra added political crap. It’s September and there are seven regular season games left so we have enough drama as it is. I like the drama involved in a heart racing, nail biting game between two good teams. It’s a beautiful game and an escape from reality (especially NOW) so can’t we just leave it at that?
Baseball is my first passion, football is my second. Well, it was….it was the one other sport I really enjoyed when baseball was over. I have been a fan of a poor football team for years and stood by them but at this point it’s too much political mumbo jumbo for me to actually watch a game. Suddenly football became the drama filled gossip girls crowd I worked so hard to avoid in High School. I respect your opinion whatever it may be but I want to see you PLAY THE GAME and hear about all of the news that comes form that…..not from you “taking a knee” and causing Americans everywhere to debate about whether it is right or wrong.
That is why I stopped watching. Colin Kaepernick started drama, is now UNEMPLOYED and I no longer watch football.
Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports
And now suddenly the “take a knee” fiasco finally made it into my baseball world and I admit it annoys me! Congratulations rookie kid I couldn’t care less about Bruce Maxwell of the Oakland A’s. You “took a knee” and sent a message. You are incredibly young and have much to learn in life and in baseball. You’ve had your 15 minutes of fame and brought a bunch of drama into the game I love. Now who is next? Because it is coming. The newbie opened up the flood gates.
So now that it’s out there and instead of the news main focus being about the Yankees blowing two games against the Jays and likely the division….we have to read Joe Girardi,Yankees players have no plans to protest national anthem. Really? I want to start a new movement here. There’s a cliche that says politics and religion do not belong at the dinner table. How about political protests do not belong at a baseball game?

Clearly Aaron Judge gets it. I’m sure he has a very strong opinion on this too as most of us do but at least when he was asked about it he said “You know, I’m a baseball player. My job is to focus on playing baseball right now.” It is, so thank you Judge. Even CC Sabathia had an opinion on it and he made that pretty clear on Saturday but he said his peace and left it at that. So when Sunday came around he didn’t want to revisit it and said “I don’t want to talk about that. Go to somebody else’s locker and talk about protests. Why do you have to come to me? There are 40 other guys in there” read that HERE.
We have one week left in the regular season. Maxwell said his decision “had been coming for a long time” and referenced what happened in Charlottesville. He’s had a while to sit and stew on that and just now decides to join the movement and “take a knee” right at the end of the season. I don’t look at that and find that to be “brave” or admirable at all.
There are a lot of issues in our country right now, and I am not ignoring that. We saw how high emotions ran last year in football and now it’s come into baseball. Nothing has changed for the better here, so why bring it on the field?
I just want to watch some baseball, Maxwell! I didn’t know who you were before this. I know enough about you now, but it doesn’t make me want to learn anymore.
Just play ball! There’s not a lot of it left…

",KKR raises Hitachi Kokusai offer following pressure from hedge fund,"TOKYO (Reuters) - KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) has raised its offer price for Hitachi Kokusai Electric Inc (6756.T) to 2,900 yen a share from 2,503 yen, the Japanese firm said on Wednesday, after a U.S. hedge fund put pressure on the private equity firm to revise terms.
A KKR representative in Tokyo declined to comment on the revised offer.
KKR agreed in April to buy the chip-making machinery and communications and video equipment business from Hitachi Ltd (6501.T). But the deal was put on hold in August when KKR said it would continue discussions with Hitachi Kokusai after a third-party committee reporting to the Japanese firm’s board said it did not support the terms.
KKR’s improved bid also comes after U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management said last month it owned 5.01 percent of Hitachi Kokusai.
Elliott, known for buying stakes in firms in the middle of takeovers or acquisitions and seeking better deals for shareholders, then raised its stake in Hitachi Kokusai to 7.11 percent, according to a filing dated Sept. 28.
Since Elliott’s first disclosure of its stakeholding on Sept. 11 Hitachi Kokusai’s share price has risen 12.5 percent and is now trading 24 percent above KKR’s original offer.
Trading in Hitachi Kokusai’s shares closed on Wednesday at 3,115 yen.
KKR plans to spend 144 billion yen to buy up to 48.33 percent of Hitachi Kokusai at 2,900 yen a share through the tender offer, which opens on Thursday, according to a statement from Hitachi Kokusai.
As part of the same deal, Hitachi Kokusai plans to buy back a 51.67 percent stake from Hitachi for 1,870 yen a share - up from an initial price of 1,710 yen - and cancel those shares.
After completion, KKR plans to spin off Hitachi Kokusai’s chip-making equipment division, retaining 100 percent ownership.
KKR will sell to Hitachi and investment fund Japan Industrial Partners Inc (JIP) 40 percent of the remaining business.
Last week, U.S. buyout firm Bain Capital LP’s offer price for Japan’s Asatsu-DK Inc (9747.T) was similarly labeled too low, by the advertising agency’s second-largest shareholder.",1

",290 arrests in anti-Putin march on Russian leader's birthday,"St. Petersburg, Russia (CNN) Russian police arrested 290 protesters in 26 cities as marches took place against President Vladimir Putin on the leader's 65th birthday, according to independent monitoring group OVD.
Thousands attended the marches on Saturday, held by supporters of Putin's only real political opponent, activist Alexei Navalny, who is serving a 20-day jail term for organizing an unauthorized public meeting.
It is very difficult to legally organize protests in Russia, where public assembly laws have been tightened several times since Putin's current presidential term began in 2012.
Demonstrators gather by a statue of poet Alexander Pushkin in an anti-Putin rally in Moscow on Saturday.
Navalny, 41, has said he intends to run for president in the next election, despite carrying an embezzlement conviction that prevents him from doing so. He claims that conviction was bogus and politically motivated to block his presidential bid.

",Yankees Pounce on Indians’ Errors and Send Series to Game 5,"The Yankees will start C. C. Sabathia against Corey Kluber, the Indians’ ace, for the opportunity to face Houston in the American League Championship Series.
The Yankees — with an assist from Urshela — pounced early on Trevor Bauer, who had shut them out for seven innings in the series opener. They rode the electric right arm of starter Luis Severino, who delivered a redemptive performance after being knocked out early in a wild-card victory over the Minnesota Twins.
Severino, with his team facing elimination and its bullpen running on fumes, relied heavily on his 100-mile-per-hour fastball over seven strong innings. He allowed four hits — including a two-run homer to Carlos Santana and a solo shot to Roberto Perez — while striking out nine.
When Michael Brantley singled with one out in the seventh and the Yankees already staked to a 7-3 lead, Manager Joe Girardi appeared headed to the mound. But the pitching coach Larry Rothschild got his attention, and Girardi returned to his perch on the top railing of the dugout.

Severino proceeded to strike out Lonnie Chisenhall for a third time and then, with another full-throated crowd chanting his name, he retired Perez on a grounder to shortstop.
His final pitch, No. 113 — the most he had thrown since July — ended the threat, but it did not stop the crowd, which sang “Sev-er-in-o” throughout the break between half-innings.
“I hear the stadium calling my name, so I know I’ve got to go over there and finish the inning,” Severino said.

Immediately after his departure, the tenuous state of the Yankees’ bullpen was exposed. Dellin Betances, who had seemed to straighten out his control problems, walked the first two hitters — including two pitches that sailed to the backstop. But Tommy Kahnle entered after the two walks and retired the heart of the Indians order — striking out Jason Kipnis, getting out Jose Ramirez on a fly ball and fanning Jay Bruce before letting out a roar.
Kahnle closed out the ninth by striking out the side.
If the Yankees seemed to ride the momentum of Sunday night’s 1-0 victory, also an elimination game, the Indians appeared to be playing with a degree of anxiety on Monday — even if Francona insisted beforehand that they would not.
“If one game changes our confidence level, we weren’t as good as I thought we were, so I would say no,” Francona said before the game. “Our guys will be fine.”

They did not appear to be. Urshela, who committed just five errors during the season, could not handle Starlin Castro’s one-out line drive in the second inning. After Bauer struck out Chase Headley in the second inning, he gave up four consecutive hits — one more than the total he allowed in the series opener.
Bauer had carved up the Yankees in the series opener, no-hitting them for five and two-thirds innings. Before that game, and earlier on Monday, Girardi said the Yankees would look for an opportunity to get inside the head of Bauer, whose unconventional training regimen and quirky personality have not always endeared him to coaches and teammates. This drew a laugh from Indians center fielder Jason Kipnis.
“I think he’s got enough of his own self in there,” Kipnis said. “There’s no room for other people’s thoughts in there.”

Kipnis warned that Bauer’s unshakable belief in himself — and in his methods — was a big reason he won a career-high 17 games this season and dominated Game 1, the third time he had beaten the Yankees this season.
“Don’t underestimate or don’t take his quirkiness or mannerisms for vulnerability,” Kipnis said. “He’s set in his ways and he’s gaining confidence this year with the way he’s been pitching.”
If the Yankees did not take up residence inside Bauer’s head, they put on a master class in reading his mind. Todd Frazier, in reaching over the plate and hooking a 3-1 curveball into the left-field corner that hit the foul line to score Castro for a 1-0 lead, took the type of swing a batter takes when he knows which pitch is coming.

And why wouldn’t he? It was the fourth curveball Bauer had thrown him in the five-pitch at-bat.
“If he throws a fastball, maybe I’m late and hit it to right, maybe I miss it,” said Frazier, who noted that Bauer tends to throw more breaking pitches with runners in scoring position. “It’s one of those things where I wasn’t guessing, but I was slowing my body down to where I was ready for it.”
Later that inning, Aaron Judge delivered a two-out, two-run double on a 3-2 pitch — a tailing, letter-high 99-mile-per-hour fastball — to stake the Yankees to a 4-0 lead. It is a pitch Judge has rarely handled this season, but it was also the same one Bauer threw past him in a full count on his first trip to the plate.
“Before I step in the box, I try to have a solid plan,” Judge said. “My plan was to stay on the heater, especially a guy like Bauer who has good stuff and has confidence. He’s going to come after you.”
That was Judge’s only hit of the series and his only contact of the night. He struck out four times and is now 1 for 15 with 12 strikeouts.
But as bad as Judge has been at the plate this series, the Indians were worse in the field on Monday. Urshela’s high throw with two out and the bases loaded in the third pulled Santana off first base, allowing Castro to score and push the Yankees’ lead to 5-0.
After the homers by Santana in the fourth and by Perez in the fifth brought the Indians to within 5-3, the Indians were betrayed by their defense again. Reliever Danny Salazar fielded Frazier’s tapper but bounced his throw badly past Santana for a two-base error. Frazier would score when Kipnis — recently moved from second base to center field — couldn’t throw him out on Brett Gardner’s shallow fly ball.
“He hasn’t played there a lot so why not take the chance?” Frazier said.
Gary Sanchez pushed the lead to 7-3 in the sixth with a home run to right field off reliever Bryan Shaw. It was the only earned run the Yankees pushed across all night, but by then the Yankees had all the help they would need.",1

",Trial set to begin in burning death of Mississippi teen,"(CNN) A jury was chosen Monday in trial of a Mississippi man accused of killing 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, who died after being set on fire in her car in 2014.
Quinton Tellis, 29, faces a capital murder charge in her slaying.
The Courtland teen's mysterious death has haunted the small town of 500 in northwest Mississippi for nearly three years. Chambers left her mother's house in pajama pants on December 6, 2014, reportedly to clean her car.
She never returned.
When police found her later that night, she wasn't far from her mother's home. Her car was on fire, and Chambers had burns on more than 90% of her body.
She said someone set her on fire. When asked who hurt her, some first responders claim they heard her say a man's name. She was rushed to a hospital, where she died the next day.
Quinton Tellis
Courtland and Panola County residents learned last year that Tellis, who was being held in Louisiana in connection with a crime involving another homicide victim, was to be indicted in Chambers' death.
District Attorney John Champion said at the time he was ""very, very confident"" there would be no additional charges or suspects in the Chambers case.
""We do feel like, at this point, that he acted alone in this case,"" he said.
Video surveillance footage and DNA evidence found on Chambers' car keys near the scene will likely play a role in Tellis' prosecution, lead detective Barry Thompson told CNN in the special report ""Justice for Jessica,"" which airs Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on HLN with correspondent Randi Kaye.
The capital murder charge against Tellis opens the door for a death penalty case, but Champion said Wednesday the prosecution is not planning to seek the death penalty. The charge is capital murder because her death occurred during the commission of another crime: third-degree arson.
Tellis has pleaded not guilty. He declined requests for an interview.
Longtime mystery
Until Tellis' February 2016 indictment, investigators had released few details about how Chambers, a former high school cheerleader, and her car ended up severely burned in a wooded area near Courtland.
That could be because authorities had ascertained so little about her death until late 2015. Champion explained that police interviewed about 150 people, and each agreed to cooperate. That's odd in a case such as this, according to the prosecutor.
On four occasions, Champion said he thought the case had been solved, but he was wrong. Investigators received no information from their street sources, he said, and though authorities chased leads as far-flung as Tennessee, Iowa and eastern Mississippi, nothing panned out until they started taking a close look at cell phone and other data evidence.
Tellis was looked at early in the investigation, the prosecutor said, but he did not become investigators' focus until the fall of 2015.
""Things started to match up for us, and that's when we began to take a second look at Mr. Tellis,"" Champion said, adding that forensic evidence will be integral to driving the prosecution.

Jessica's father, Ben Chambers, a former mechanic with the Panola County Sheriff's Office, said he was in close contact with investigators throughout the investigation, and he witnessed their long nights, skipped vacations and the rings under their eyes.
""I've seen it day in and day out. The hard work they've done never stopped,"" he told reporters at the time of Tellis' indictment, a cap bearing the sheriff's office's logo atop his head. ""They said someday it would come, and it did. They would not give up, and I take my hat off to them.""
Ties to another homicide victim
Tellis was being held in the Ouachita Parish Correctional Facility in Monroe, Louisiana, almost a four-hour drive from Jessica Chambers' hometown, when he was indicted in her death.
He grew up in Courtland, and that's where, Champion said, he and Chambers became friends. They'd known one another for only two weeks at the time of the killing, according to investigators.
Tellis moved from Mississippi to Louisiana in the summer of 2015, the prosecutor said. Nearly eight months after Chambers' death, another young woman turned up dead.
Tellis pleaded guilty to the unauthorized use of an access card, which belonged to homicide victim Ming-Chen Hsiao, whom investigators identified as a 34-year-old University of Louisiana-Monroe student from Taiwan.
He was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
According to a probable cause affidavit in that case, Tellis used a bank debit card belonging to the missing woman on August 7, the day before The Clarion-Ledger reports her body was found, and then again on August 18 and 19, withdrawing $500 both times.
Authorities procured ""photo evidence"" and interviewed Tellis on August 20, at which point ""he admitted to using the Chase Bank debit card on the three listed transactions and stated that he was the individual seen in the ATM photos,"" the affidavit said.
The authorities say Tellis remains the prime suspect in Hsiao's death, but he has never been charged in that case.
He was extradited from Louisiana to Mississippi to face the Chambers murder charge.
Tellis' rap sheet
Following the probe into the debit card, police executed a search warrant at Tellis' Monroe home and discovered a quarter-pound of marijuana in his bedroom, packaged for sale.
The suspect ""stated he sold marijuana for profit. Tellis was arrested and booked"" on an additional charge of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, according to the affidavit.
According to law enforcement, Tellis is a gang member with a rap sheet and has served time previously, but his gang affiliation does not appear to have anything to do with Chambers' killing, and drugs do not appear to be a factor in her death, Champion said.
Mississippi Department of Corrections records indicate Tellis was convicted of fleeing police in 2010 and sentenced to five years in prison. He was convicted of residential burglary in December 2011 and again in February 2012. He received sentences of four years and three years, respectively, on those convictions.
He was incarcerated in June 2011, according to court records. Tellis was released from a Mississippi correctional facility on October 2014 after serving time for the burglaries, Champion said. That's two months before Chambers was killed.
'She just seemed normal'
One of Chambers friends, Kesha Meyer, told CNN that she, Tellis and Chambers spent time together on the day of the blaze. But he denies killing her.
On December 6, 2014, Chambers was seen at a gas station about two miles from her mother's house. Her hair was in a bun, and she was wearing camouflage pajama pants.
She put $14 worth of gas in the car and called her mother, saying she would be home right after she cleaned her car, her older sister, Amanda Prince, told CNN.
A store surveillance video shows Chambers prepaying for gas. She walks to the store's front door when something or someone catches her attention.
She waves and walks off camera briefly, comes back into the camera's view and enters the store as three men chat by the doorway. She spends about a minute at the counter before going back outside and pumping gas.
The gas station owner who helped her said nothing seemed out of the ordinary.
""She seemed normal,"" Ali Alsanai told WREG in 2014. ""She didn't seem like something was going wrong, you know? She just seemed normal. She just pumped some gas, we had a talk and she left.""
Champion said he did not believe Chambers' visit to the gas station had anything to do with her death.

Chambers was found that Saturday night on a rural road near Courtland, her car on fire. She'd somehow fought her way out of the burning vehicle and was no longer on fire when emergency responders arrived, but she had burns on 93% of her body.
Chambers approached Courtland Fire Chief Cole Haley and said someone set her on fire.
Asked who did it, she told first responders ""Eric"" or ""Derrick,"" according to Champion. Not ""Quinton.""
It's a point the defense may seize on. However, police investigators learned from medical experts that burns in Chambers' airway may have impeded her ability to talk.
Chambers died in a Memphis hospital early the next day.",1

","Brexit talks deadlock on cash, Barnier eyes move by December","European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier holds a joint news conference with Britain's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis after the latest round of talks in Brussels, Belgium October 12, 2017. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brexit talks are deadlocked over money, the EU’s Michel Barnier said on Thursday as he ruled out discussions on future trade being launched by EU leaders next week but spoke of possible progress by December.
Barnier and his British counterpart, Brexit Secretary David Davis, told reporters there had been some progress this week on the other two issues around Britain’s March 2019 withdrawal from the bloc on which the EU demands “sufficient progress” before it will agree to discuss a transition and future relationship.
With concern mounting about the possibility they might run out of time for any deal, Davis renewed his call for EU leaders to give a green light to trade talks after they meet Prime Minister Theresa May at a summit in Brussels next Thursday.
Barnier made clear, however, that despite new momentum from concessions given by May in a speech at Florence last month, British proposals on expatriate citizens’ rights and the Irish border still failed the EU test, while London’s refusal to spell out a detailed cash offer was “very worrying” for business.
May said then that the other 27 countries would not lose out financially from Brexit in the current EU budget period to 2020 and that Britain would honor commitments -- but Barnier said London was failing to say exactly what it was ready to pay.
“Regarding that question, we are at an impasse, which is very worrying for thousands of projects everywhere in Europe and also worrying for those who contribute,” he said.
Nonetheless, he offered hope: “I am still convinced that, with political will, decisive progress is within reach in the coming two months. With David Davis, we will organize several negotiating meetings between now and the end of the year.”
With signs that nerves are fraying on both sides as less than 18-month remains before the deadline, some hardline Brexit supporters want May to just walk out of talks. Both negotiators repeated that they were ready for any eventuality including a collapse. But, Barnier warned, “no deal would be a very bad deal”.
May herself said there had been “good progress” and welcomed Barnier’s talk of further progress “over the coming weeks”.
RESIDENCE RIGHTS

Davis announced a “streamlined” new system for the 3 million EU citizens in Britain to claim residence rights, answering EU concerns, and said he expected good further progress on other issues. Barnier repeated that Brussels stills wants them to have recourse to EU judges to safeguard their rights and said there were still differences on rights for future family members.
A British demand for its million or so citizens on the continent to have lifetime rights to move to any of the bloc’s 27 countries after Brexit is held up by doubts among the member states. Barnier said those are rights to do with post-Brexit decisions and should be dealt with in the next phase of talks.
“I make no secret of the fact that to provide certainty we must talk about the future,” Davis said, stressing his demand for trade talks. “I hope the leaders of the 27 will provide Michel with the means to explore ways forward with us on that.”
Slideshow (3 Images)
“As we look to the October Council next week, I hope the member states will recognize the progress we’ve made and take a step forward in the spirit of the prime minister’s Florence speech.”
Barnier was pressed to say in public whether he would ask EU leaders’ permission to make some preliminary exploration of what a transition after March 2019 would look like. EU officials and diplomats say he has raised that issue with governments.
He told the news conference that he would follow a mandate ruling out any discussion of the future before issues arising from Britain’s past membership are settled and said it was important to respect the “sequencing”.
Diplomats have said that German and French envoys quashed a suggestion by Barnier last week that he start looking transition issues. On Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose scope to change policy is limited by ongoing coalition talks, stressed Berlin would negotiate to minimize damage to Germany.
With the talks poised at a delicate stage, EU officials say it is unclear what leaders will tell May next week. They all rule out a clear move to trade talks but many expect “positive language” to try to defuse British accusations of Brussels intransigence and to help May stand up to her own party critics.
Officials see the early part of next year as a virtual deadline for agreeing to move on to discuss the future relationship. Failure to do so would raise the risk of there being no smooth transition and even of no deal at all.

On Wednesday, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s competition commissioner, ordered Luxembourg to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon. The ruling was tied to an agreement between the country and the company that the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said dated to 2003.
The order resembles a similar move the commission made last year, when it directed Ireland to reclaim around $15.2 billion from Apple.
Ireland fears that such a decision could make it a less attractive place for multinational companies. In a sign of the disquiet in Dublin about that order, the Irish government failed to meet a January deadline to collect the money. It has appealed the ruling.
That earned Ireland a forceful rebuke from Ms. Vestager.
A year later, “Ireland has not recovered any money, not even in part,” she said, warning the country to accelerate its efforts to avoid “more conflictual waters,” a reference to the prospects for a lengthy court battle.
Although litigation to force Ireland to recoup the taxes could drag on for years, the commission has successfully sued countries in the past and punished them with large fines for failing to recover money from companies that received illegal state aid.
At the time of the ruling, Europe’s competition watchdogs said that Apple’s arrangements with Dublin were illegal and had ensured the iPhone maker paid virtually nothing on its European business in some years. Brussels argued that the deals allowed Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to an office in which it had “no employees, no premises, no real activities.”
The Irish Department of Finance said that it “has never accepted the commission’s analysis” in the Apple case and that it was taken aback by Ms. Vestager’s decision to take the country to court. The department said it had “made significant progress on this complex issue” and accused the European authorities of taking a “wholly unnecessary step.”

Apple did not immediately comment on the latest move, but has criticized the ruling in the past. The original decision has also drawn the ire of the United States Treasury Department.

In the case of Amazon, the commission said Wednesday that Luxembourg had reduced its tax bill for more than eight years, from 2006 to 2014, and had conferred on the company a selective advantage. The arrangement essentially capped the amount of tax that the retailer paid, and relied on a method known as transfer pricing.
Typically, transfer pricing has been used by companies to assign revenues and profits to different business units depending on their location, role in the overall company and assets. But that system is harder to police with technology companies because many of their biggest assets, like intellectual property, are intangible. The European Commission said that Amazon had abused this system by sending most of its European revenue to a Luxembourg subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax, helping the company cut its overall bill.
Ms. Vestager said the arrangement had “no valid economic justification” and that the company had been able to “avoid taxation on almost three quarters of the profits it made from all Amazon sales in the E.U.”
Amazon and Luxembourg have denied the charges.
“We believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that it “paid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law.”
Amazon said it would study the commission’s ruling and was considering whether to appeal.
In a statement, Luxembourg’s finance ministry also contested Ms. Vestager’s ruling. “As Amazon has been taxed in accordance with the tax rules applicable at the relevant time, Luxembourg considers that the company has not been granted incompatible state aid,” it said.
It is not illegal in the European Union for member states to attempt to lure businesses by lowering corporate tax rates. But, as with Amazon’s agreement with Luxembourg, offering special deals to select companies that are not made available to rivals can amount to “illegal state aid.”
The investigations are among several in which commission officials have looked into the affairs of Silicon Valley companies. Regulators in Brussels are challenging Google and Qualcomm over alleged antitrust violations, and officials in various countries have investigated Facebook over its handling of customers’ data.
Ms. Vestager has made taxes a priority of her term as Europe’s competition commissioner. In that time, she has penalized Starbucks in the Netherlands and Anheuser-Busch InBev in Belgium. But Luxembourg has been a particular target: In 2015, she told the country to claw back about €30 million from a Fiat Chrysler unit, while a case considering Luxembourg’s treatment of McDonald’s is also continuing.

“I don’t think that we’re done,” Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday, adding that new laws were also necessary. “The main part of the solution is of course that we have legislation that gives you a transparent tax landscape and enables national tax authorities to do their job.”
A broader overhaul may be afoot. The European Commission published proposals last month under which internet companies would be taxed in the countries where they generated revenue. Such a shift would mean the companies could not move their profits to jurisdictions with lower taxes.
A push in that direction could, however, prove complicated and carries several risks, said Clemens Fuest, the director of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, a prominent think tank in Germany. In particular, European governments still might devise a host of new incentives to lure investment, while legislative changes at the European level could prompt retaliation by major trading partners.
“There are real dangers if Brussels keeps acting unilaterally,” Mr. Fuest said.
The European Union stepped up efforts to curb tax avoidance by companies and by individuals after the financial crisis, which forced many of the bloc’s member states to cut public services and raise tax rates. But opponents of the austerity programs argued that big corporations had not faced the same pressures, partly because they have long been able to shift their profits to low-tax countries.",1

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Business leaders attending a U.S.-Mexico CEO conference said on Wednesday that no North American Free Trade Agreement would be better than a bad deal, as industry braces for the end of a treaty that drives $1 trillion in annual trade.
The CEO meeting ran in parallel to talks near Washington aimed at refreshing the 1994 agreement, with Mexico, Canada and businesses united in opposition to a number of radical U.S. proposals they say would damage the North American economy.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would be open to bilateral trade pacts with Mexico or Canada if a deal cannot be reached to substantially revise NAFTA.
“We are all much worse off with a bad agreement than with no (NAFTA),” said Guillermo Vogel, who co-chaired the Mexico City event and is a vice president at Tenaris, a steel company.
The meeting, part of a bilateral “CEO dialogue” that meets a couple of times each year, included a closed-door discussion on the NAFTA negotiations addressed by Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray and Economy Minister Idelfonso Guajardo, who are in charge of the negotiations for Mexico.
On the U.S. side the event was co-chaired by Fedex Freight’s CEO Michael Ducker and U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue.
The event’s organizers declined to say who else attended. American Express, AT&T, GM and Delta were listed on publicity material for an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Mexico on Tuesday, where Donohue warned that several U.S. proposals in the NAFTA talks were “poison pills” that risked dooming the agreement.
The process of renegotiating NAFTA has turned increasingly sour. Mexico accuses Trump of spoiling for a “protectionist war” with proposals aimed at balancing trade.

Those proposals include removing dispute resolution mechanisms, limiting trade in fresh produce and introducing minimum quotas for U.S. parts in autos.
While better than a bad deal, Vogel said the failure of NAFTA would be a “lose-lose” situation, and that U.S.-Mexico trade without it could lead to a U.S. trade deficit larger than the current $64 billion.
Without NAFTA, Mexico trade experts say U.S. products would face higher tariffs to enter Mexico, which could further skew the trade balance.
“The clear focus was that we have to send a message to all the different constituencies about how much of an error it would be to cancel NAFTA, or make a bad NAFTA,” Vogel said in an interview with Reuters.
He said content rules for auto parts were still negotiable, despite shock in Mexico at suggestions half of all parts in cars should be made in the United States. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Wednesday he expected an agreement would be reached on that issue.
On Tuesday, Donohue also singled out a “sunset clause” that would automatically terminate NAFTA every five years unless there were fresh negotiations.
“Clearly, a clause that cancels the agreement every five years totally defangs it,” Vogel said. “Starting to play with a non-market economy would be terrible for us.”
Vogel said U.S. and Mexican businesses still believed NAFTA talks would produce a good deal and said they would continue to lobby their governments and lawmakers to negotiate a good deal.
“With an agreement, in 10 years I see a strong region that can face Asia or China, without an agreement I see a weaker region in the medium and long term.”",1

",U.S. still seeking explanation for arrest of staff in Turkey: ambassador,"U.S. Ambassador to Turkey John Bass speaks during a meeting with media members in Ankara, Tukey, October 11, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer
ANKARA (Reuters) - The United States is still seeking an explanation from Ankara for the detention of staff at U.S. missions in Turkey which led Washington to stop issuing visas and triggered a diplomatic crisis, the U.S. ambassador said on Wednesday.
Ambassador John Bass said the decision to suspend granting visas was not taken lightly, but the detentions indicated a breakdown in communication between the two NATO allies, whose relations have come under increasing strain.
“Unfortunately... the U.S. government still has not received any official communications from the Turkish government about the reasons why our local employees have been detained or arrested,” he told reporters at the U.S. embassy in Ankara.
Washington says two locally employed staff were arrested in Turkey this year. In May, a translator at the consulate in the southern province of Adana was arrested and last week a Drug Enforcement Administration worker was detained in Istanbul.
President Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman said last week the Istanbul employee, Metin Topuz, had been in contact with a leading suspect in last year’s failed military coup. Turkish media reported similar accusations against the translator.
“The notion that people in our employment are facing or are under suspicion of terrorism charges here, that is a very serious allegation,” Bass said. “It is one we want to take seriously and we want to better understand the ostensible evidence that supports these allegations”.
Since the failed military coup in July last year, in which at least 240 people were killed, more than 50,000 people have been detained and 150,000, including teachers, academics, soldiers and journalists, have been suspended from work.
Some Western allies fear the crackdown shows the country is slipping ever deeper into authoritarian rule under Erdogan.
Ankara says its critics fail to understand the scale of the security challenges in Turkey, which has also faced conflict on its southern borders with Iraq and Syria, and an insurgency in its mainly Kurdish southeast.

ENVOY TARGETED
Erdogan has blamed Bass for the latest dispute, suggesting he acted unilaterally in suspending visa services and declaring that his government no longer considered Bass to be Washington’s envoy and would not hold meetings with him.
The U.S. State Department denied Bass acted alone, saying his actions were coordinated with officials in Washington.
In a sign that Ankara was stepping back from the pledge to exclude Bass, Turkish television channels reported that he met a foreign ministry official later on Wednesday. The ambassador is due to leave Turkey within days to take up a post in Afghanistan.
U.S.-Turkish tensions have risen in recent months over U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey.
Turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the United States to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally of Erdogan who is viewed in Ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup.
Another source of friction was the U.S. indictment of Turkey’s former economy minister Zafer Caglayan for conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran. A U.S. court also indicted 15 of Erdogan’s guards after they clashed with protesters during his visit to Washington in May.
In addition to the two detained consulate workers, Turkey is holding a U.S. pastor on charges which Turkish media say include membership of Gulen’s network. Bass called for the release of the Christian missionary, Andrew Brunson, saying he had seen nothing of merit in the charges against him.
He denied reports that Turkish police were trying to speak to another consulate employee. “To the best of our knowledge there are not any outstanding requests from Turkish law enforcement officials for any of our local staff to come in and talk to them,” he said.",1

",Scientists And Physicians Send Appeal About 5G Rollout And Health Dangers To The European Union,"By Catherine J. Frompovich
On September 13, 2017, more than 180 scientists and doctors sent an 11-page Appeal for a moratorium on the roll out of 5G in the European Union.
The reason for the appeal is “RF/EMF has been proven to be harmful for humans and the environment,” but 5G has not been investigated fully for potential health hazards and environmental impact by INDEPENDENT scientists, rather than industry scientists who apparently would rubber stamp 5G similarly as the other generations of telecommunications updates have been.
According to the Appeal, 5G is effective only over short distances and is transmitted poorly through solid materials. Because of that inefficiency in transmission, a tremendous number of antennas or cell towers will be needed to implement 5G service.
One key paragraph jumped out for me:
With “the ever more extensive use of wireless technologies,” nobody can avoid to be exposed. Because on top of the increased number of 5G-transmitters (even within housing, shops and in hospitals) according to estimates, ”10 to 20 billion connections” (to refrigerators, washing machines, surveillance cameras, self-driving cars and buses, etc.) will be parts of the Internet of Things. All these together can cause a substantial increase in the total, long term RF-EMF exposure to all EU citizens . [CJF emphasis]
Unfortunate as it is, there are no studies for long-term RF/EMF exposures to humans that I neither know about nor have found in my research. That deliberate omission seems to be the most incriminating aspect of probable collusion on the part of “consensus science,” which apparently motivates and propels microwave technology, the industry and, in particular, its professional associations that impact microwave ‘policy’ at the United Nations, World Health Organization and its IARC, and the U.S. Federal Communication Commission.
“[N]umerous recent scientific publications have shown that EMF affects living organisms at levels well below most international and national guidelines,” including “increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plants and animals.”
The Appeal notes:
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the cancer agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2011 concluded that EMFs of frequencies 30 KHz – 300 GHz are possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). However, new studies like the NTP study mentioned above and several epidemiological investigations including the latest studies on mobile phone use and brain cancer risks confirm that RF-EMF radiation is carcinogenic to humans.
The scientists and doctors point out the Precautionary Principle, adopted by the EU in 2005, states:
When human activities may lead to morally unacceptable harm that is scientifically plausible but uncertain, actions shall be taken to avoid or diminish that harm.
Unfortunately, in this writer’s opinion, the Precautionary Principle has been negated for all intents and purposes by medicine and science in favor of corporate profiteering, “consensus science” and downright falsified or ‘vintage’ research, plus marketing strategies to promote less-than-accurate facts regarding pharmaceuticals, microwave technology and much of the “smart” meme.
Under “Safety Guidelines,” the Appeal emphasizes how industry is protected, but not human health:
The current ICNIRP “safety guidelines” are obsolete. All proofs of harm mentioned above arise although the radiation is below the ICNIRP “safety guidelines”. Therefore new safety standards are necessary. The reason for the misleading guidelines is that “conflict of interest of ICNIRP members due to their relationships with telecommunications or electric companies undermine the impartiality that should govern the regulation of Public Exposure Standards for non-ionizing radiation…To evaluate cancer risks it is necessary to include scientists with competence in medicine, especially oncology.” [CJF emphasis] The current ICNIRP/WHO guidelines for EMF are based on the obsolete hypothesis that “The critical effect of RF-EMF exposure relevant to human health and safety is heating of exposed tissue.” However, scientists have proven that many different kinds of illnesses and harms are caused without heating (”non-thermal effect”) at radiation levels well below ICNIRP guidelines.
The problem apparently is ICNIRP seems to be running the show “science-wise,” while it’s really behind the times, especially since ICNIRP refuses to accept non-thermal waves and adverse effects, which 32 percent of industry-funded-research proved they exist! Talk about Neanderthals! What rock has ICNIRP been under all this time?
The Appeal offers five recommendations the European Union ought to follow, especially “to study the total and cumulative exposure affecting EU-citizens.” Cumulative exposure is KEY to any study whether it is assessing a chemical or a pollutant, which microwave EMFs/RFs truly are. They create “electrosmog.”
The Appeal has 7 pages of signatories from around the globe, including 23 from the USA.
Let’s hope a similar Appeal is presented to the U.S. Federal Communication Commission, which apparently is totally off-base regarding its safety recommendations.

","Smart Devices are Listening to (and Saving) Everything You Say, Here’s How to Stop It","By Rachel Blevins
The idea that the smart devices in your home and on your phone are listening to you—and recording what you are saying—is nothing new, and many Americans have become complacent with the breach of their privacy because of the convenience provided by the technology. However, it is still possible to maintain some crucial privacy with some of the most popular apps. Here are a few steps you can take:
Facebook
No matter what crazy updates or changes the app undergoes, the fact is that Facebook is a monster; and whether they criticize it or not, more than 1 billion people have Facebook accounts.
One of the many problems with Facebook is that one of its updates has included giving the app access to your microphone when you use Facebook Messenger. While the excuse Facebook gave was that it needed access to the microphone in order to shoot live video within the app, the idea that Facebook has access to your smart phone’s microphone at all times is unsettling, to say the least.
iPhone Users: Go to Settings, click on Privacy, click on Microphone, and then slide the switch to the left on Messenger, turning it from green to white to turn it off.
Android Users: Go to Settings, click on Applications, then click on Application Manager, go to Facebook, click on Permissions, and then click on Turn off the mic.
Siri
iPhone users are all too familiar with the virtual friend living inside their smartphone, and while users often ask Siri a range of random questions, she is always listening—and even if the device is locked, saying “Hey Siri,” records your request and uploads the audio file to Apple’s servers for processing.
For iPhones using iOS 8 and later, Apple has made it so that even when the device is locked, the command of “Hey Siri” will activate the feature and give access to the phone. However, if you have experienced this new feature, you may have found that there are times when Siri is activated, even though you did not intentionally give the command.
How to turn it off: Click on Settings, go to Siri, and then toggle off Allow “Hey Siri.” For more security, also toggle off Access When Locked.
Google
While iPhone users have “Hey Siri,” Android users have “OK Google,” which also applies to Google Home speakers. With this feature, when a user says “OK Google” the device automatically begins recording and the audio it obtains is saved to your Google account.
How to turn it off on Android devices: Go to Settings, click on Google, then click on Voice and turn off “OK Google” detection.
Cortana
For Microsoft users, there is an equivalent to the voice-activated assistants “Hey Siri” and “OK Google,” called “Hey Cortana,” which has similar features.
The same privacy concerns have been raised by users who are worried about the amount of data Microsoft devices are storing as soon as the command “Hey Cortana” is allegedly heard.
How to turn it off: On your Windows computer, go to Cortana, select the Notebook icon in the right column, click on Settings and then toggle off “Hey Cortana.”
Amazon Echo
Amazon presents a new challenge, based on the fact that the assistant on its Echo device is not just activated by a phrase such as “Hey Alexa.” Instead, it is activated by a number of wake words, including, “Alexa,” “Amazon,” “Computer” and “Echo.”
While it is possible to turn off the microphone by clicking a button on top of the Echo device, that microphone is required to use the device in the first place. However, users do have the ability to track what Alexa has recorded and to delete it.
To track and delete recordings: Open the Alexa app, click on Settings, then click on History. You can then select and delete each entry.

This article was written by Evan from Fantasy Sports US.com. Check them out for premium NFL DFS lineups.
The NFL season sure moves quickly. The good news is we can now start to use this year’s data and trends to help guide us in our roster construction. Let’s take a look at the week 4 slate and see if anything stands out. As always, we will stick to the main slate of games and keep in mind it’s Tuesday and our thought process will change before final lock on Sunday.
Are you ready? Let’s go.
Buffalo vs Atlanta: Be careful with your love for the Bills this week. The Bills are a much better team at home than on the road so let’s not get too excited about their win vs Denver Broncos last week. I expect Buffalo to have some success on the ground against the Falcons but ultimately Atlanta has way too many weapons for The Bills defense to deal with. We need to monitor the health of Julio Jones.
Panthers vs Patriots: This should be a Mike Gillislee game in theory as the Panthers just don’t have the weapons to compete with the Patriots. I had the same thoughts last week and Houston gave me palpitations as I saw my suicide pool pick about to get flushed down the toilet. At this point the way Tom Brady is playing he can throw five touchdown passes against anyone against any opponent. As for the Panthers Cam Newton is hurt and his skill position players have been decimated leaving me with zero interest here.
Bengals vs Browns: The Bengals defense has played well for the most part so I have interest here. As for the offense Dalton, Green and Mixon are all in play.
Titans vs Texans: Same here this could be a very good defensive game but I’m not sure if I want to use these teams in my roster builds this week. Giants vs Tampa Bay When I saw the over under in this game at 44 points I was rather surprised as this game should have sneaky shoot out potential.
Other Games: I have very little interest in the Cleveland offense this week Detroit vs Minnesota No line on this game as of yet Jaguar vs Jets. Is it possible that the Jets could be 2-2 by the end of the week. Not likely but it is possible. Only interest here is on the defenses Rams vs Cowboys. If you watched the game last night the Cardinals absolutely destroyed the Cowboys with their passing game. The problem is the Rams don’t have a Larry Fitzgerald . The Rams defense has not performed well against the run so feel free to fire up Ezekiel Elliot in this matchup. Steelers vs Ravens I’m more interested in watching this game than deploying players on my fantasy rosters.
It looks like the Giants have already abandoned the running game and will be a pass heavy offense. I can see a scenario where there is a ton of passing on the Tampa bay side as well. The Giants are very weak against the tight end so we can look at Cameron Brate as a cheap tight end this week. Eagles vs Chargers I love this game but I need some clarity on the injury situation of Melvin Gordon for the Chargers.
In addition, I need to figure out who will get the lion’s share of touches on the Eagles back field . The passing game and quarterbacks from both teams are in play for me. San Francisco vs Arizona Love the Arizona defense in this matchup as they really only need to stop Carlos Hyde . Carson Palmer and the Arizona passing game are firmly in play Raiders vs Broncos. The Raiders played terrible on Sunday night and we have to monitor the health of Michael Crabtree . As for the Broncos, I expect C J Anderson to have a better game this week . I’m not opposed to using the Denver passing game against the Raiders as their passing game is better and funneled to Emmanuel Sanders and Deamaryus Thomas.
Colts vs Seahawks: The whole Seattle offense and defense are in play as this game has blow out written all over it . Fade the Colts Time to put in the research . Until we meet again on our DFS podcast on Friday Email Evan : exboxes@gmail.com
Sample Fan Duel Cash Lineup:
Russell Wilson
Todd Gurley
Christian Mccaffrey
Larry Fitzgerald

","Weakening Nate brings rain, tornado warnings to U.S. South","BILOXI/PASCAGOULA, Miss. (Reuters) - Hurricane Nate weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday after coming ashore in Mississippi, flooding roads and buildings but sparing the state from catastrophic damages.
Maximum sustained winds from Nate, the fourth major storm to hit the United States in less than two months, dropped to 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour) as it moved through Alabama and into Tennessee.
The remnants of the storm spawned tornado warnings in those states and the western portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. It is forecast to bring gusty winds and up to 4 inches (10 cm) of rain to parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York on Monday.
The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest designation by the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Only a few hours earlier, its winds had been blowing at 70 mph (113 kph) but appeared to lack the devastating punch of its recent predecessors.
Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant told reporters there had been no deaths or reports of catastrophic damage. “We are very fortunate this morning and have been blessed,” he said.
Nate killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and bearing down on the U.S. South. It has also shut down most oil and gas production in the Gulf.
Nate follows hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which have devastated areas of the Caribbean and southern United States.
The tropical depression’s center will move up through Alabama into Tennessee and Kentucky through Monday, the hurricane center said. Heavy rainfall and storm-surge flooding remained a danger across the region, and the hurricane center said Florida’s Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia might feel tropical storm-force wind gusts.
The storm was expected to bring three to six inches of rain to parts of western North Carolina through midday Monday, with up to 10 inches possible in isolated spots. Power outages, damaged homes and roads closed by debris were all reported in the region.
Nate made its first U.S. landfall on Saturday evening near the mouth of the Mississippi River and then made a second one early on Sunday near Biloxi, Mississippi.
In Biloxi, water surged over roads during the storm and quickly receded on Sunday, leaving a boat that broke loose marooned on the beach. At a Waffle House restaurant, the storm surge deposited a dumpster in its parking lot.
Jeff Pickich, a 46-year-old wine salesman from D‘Iberville, Mississippi, was counting his blessings. Heavy winds left only minor damage, blowing down part of a fence on his rental property in Biloxi.
“I‘m just glad,” he said, digging fresh holes for fence posts. “I was afraid of the water. The water is Mother Nature. You can’t stop it.”
Water flowed through Ursula Staten’s yard in Biloxi, pushing over part of her fence and scattering debris, but did not breach her house.
“I have a mess,” the retired massage therapist said. “If we had got Irma, I would have lost everything.”

At the Golden Nugget Casino, one of eight Biloxi gaming establishments, workers rushed to clean up mud, debris and minor damage from 3 feet (1 m) of water sloshing into an entrance and the parkade. The gaming room stayed dry.
Three hundred guests remained in the hotel, some eager to try their luck after surviving Nate.
But dangers from the storm remain, with Florida Governor Rick Scott warning of tornadoes springing up in the Panhandle region and Alabama Governor Kay Ivey urging residents to prepare for strong winds and storm surges.
U.S. President Donald Trump declared federal emergencies in Alabama and Florida on Sunday, which provides additional funding for disaster relief.
Mississippi Power had restored electricity to 10,000 customers, but 4,800 were still without it. More than 1,000 people had arrived at shelters, the state Emergency Management Agency said.

Alabama Power said it had restored electricity to 58,000 of 146,000 customers who lost it.
Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm), with a maximum of 10 inches (25 cm), was expected east of the Mississippi River in Alabama and Tennessee, the hurricane center said.
NEW ORLEANS THREAT DOWNGRADED
Forecast at one point to make landfall in Louisiana, Nate headed farther east and spared many New Orleans parishes that were devastated by Hurricane Katrina 12 years ago.
“I had prayed for this - that we would be spared,” said Amos Cormier, president of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana’s equivalent to a county.
Bernice Barthelemy, a 70-year-old Louisiana resident, died from cardiac arrest overnight after telling Reuters on Saturday that she did not mind having to evacuate, Cormier said on Sunday. He attributed her death to the stress of the move.
New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said he expected that evacuated residents could return home soon.
Vessel traffic and port operations at New Orleans resumed on Sunday afternoon, while the Port of Mobile in Alabama remained closed. Oil ports, producers and refiners in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were planning reopenings as the storm moved inland on Sunday.
The storm curtailed 92 percent of daily oil production and 77 percent of daily natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico, more than three times the amount affected by Harvey.
The storm doused Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 16 people in Nicaragua, 10 in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador.",1

",Israeli and Palestinian women on peace march,"Jerusalem (CNN) Under a white tent on the shores of the Dead Sea, Huda Abuarquob's frustration melted away. Dancing arm-in-arm with thousands of Israeli and Palestinian women, she felt hope surround her.
The women, who came together Sunday morning in the ""Peace Tent,"" had marched through the desert to the lowest point on earth, to demand an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Many were dressed in white as a symbol of peace.
The march was the culmination of two weeks of events, attended by more than 30,000 women, throughout Israel and the West Bank, organized by Women Wage Peace, a grassroots organization calling for a ""bilaterally acceptable political agreement.""
Thousands of women gathered to demand that their leaders work towards a peace agreement.
After watching political leaders on both sides of the intractable conflict fail to bring peace, Abuarquob, a Palestinian from the West Bank city of Hebron, felt it was time for women to make their mark ""because women matter, because women are inclusive, because women gave so much trust to the leaders here and the leaders failed us.""
The last round of negotiations, led by then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, fell apart in April 2014, with the two sides blaming each other. A few months later, Israel and Gaza were at war.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - OPEC’s Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo on Tuesday called on U.S. shale oil producers to help curtail global oil supply, warning extraordinary measures might be needed next year to sustain the rebalanced market in the medium to long term.
“We urge our friends, in the shale basins of North America to take this shared responsibility with all seriousness it deserves, as one of the key lessons learnt from the current unique supply-driven cycle,” said Barkindo.
The comments by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries official came during a speech delivered at the India Energy Forum organized by CERAWeek in New Delhi.
“At the moment we (OPEC and independent U.S. producers) both agreed that we have a shared responsibility in maintaining stability because they are also not insulated from the impact of this downturn,” Barkindo said, referring to a slide in oil prices that spurred OPEC to agree production cuts late last year.

“The call by independents themselves (is) that we need to continue this interaction,” he said.
While OPEC and some other producers, including Russia have cut supplies this year in order to prop up prices, U.S. production has soared by almost 10 percent this year, driven largely by shale drillers. Barkindo said he hoped that new producers, not just U.S. shale drillers, would join production cuts.
On Monday, Saudi Arabia cut crude oil allocations for November by 560,000 barrels per day (bpd), in line with the kingdom’s commitment to the supply reduction pact.
“Demand-supply is returning to rebalance through massive destocking that we have been witnessing of stocks in OECD across regions in a very massive way,” Barkindo said later, speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the conference.
“In the past four months alone, we have seen destocking to the tune of 130 million bpd,” he said.
The aim of the OPEC-led cut is to trim the level of oil in OECD industrialized countries compared with the five-year supply average. Barkindo said the stock overhang to the five-year average stood at 171 million barrels in August, against 338 million at the start of the year.
“The speed and pace (of destocking) has accelerated as a result of anticipated and projected demand growth in the second half of 2017 to the tune of 2 million bpd. We are witnessing a fast return to a balanced market,” Barkindo said.
Still, on Sunday Barkindo said OPEC and other oil producers might need to take “some extraordinary measures” next year to rebalance the oil market.
World oil demand growth in 2017 is expected at 1.45 million barrels per day (BPD) and it should stay around 1.4 million bpd in 2018, Barkindo said. He said India’s share of global oil demand is expected to rise to over 9 percent by 2040, up from 4 percent now.",1

","U.S. bombs dropped in Afghanistan at highest since 2010, under new Trump strategy","KABUL (Reuters) - American warplanes in Afghanistan are dropping bombs in numbers not seen since the height of the U.S. troop surge in 2010, after President Donald Trump announced a new strategy in August to ease attack curbs and widen the range of militant targets.
In September, for example, the U.S. Air Force dropped 751 bombs, an increase of nearly 50 percent from the August figure of 503, to reach its highest single-month total in seven years, military data showed.
“The increase can be attributed to the president’s strategy to more proactively target extremist groups that threaten the stability and security of the Afghan people,” the Air Force said in a monthly report.
Six more F-16 fighter bombers have been deployed to Bagram air field north of the Afghan capital of Kabul, and additional massive B-52 bombers have been assigned to strike Afghanistan from bases in the Persian Gulf, it added.
The Air Force numbers exclude strikes by the U.S. Army, which maintains armed helicopters and other aircraft in Afghanistan.
Trump’s South Asia strategy included promises to expand authority for U.S. forces to target militants in Afghanistan.
“These killers need to know they have nowhere to hide; that no place is beyond the reach of American might and Americans’ arms,” Trump said in his August speech unveiling the strategy.
“Retribution will be fast and powerful.”
Former President Barack Obama’s plans to drawdown the U.S. mission in Afghanistan often limited U.S. troops to attacking the Taliban only in certain circumstances, such as self-defense.
This month, Defense Secretary James Mattis confirmed to Congress that those restrictions would be lifted under Trump’s plan.",1

",US Seeks to Monopolize Cyberwarfare,"By Ulson Gunnar
The use of information to enhance martial power goes back to the beginning of human civilization itself, where propaganda and psychological warfare went hand-in-hand with slings, arrows, swords and shields.
The most recent iteration of this takes the form of social media and cyberwarfare where tools are being developed and deployed to influence populations at home and abroad, to manipulate political processes of foreign states and even tap into and exploit global economic forces.
In the beginning of the 21st Century, the United States held an uncontested monopoly over the tools of cyberwarfare. Today, this is changing quickly, presenting an increasingly balanced cyberscape where nations are able to defend themselves on near parity with America’s ability to attack them.
To reassert America’s control over information and the technology used to broker it, Jared Cohen, current Google employee and former US State Department staff, has proposed a US-created and dominated “international” framework regarding cyberconflict.
His op-ed in the New York Times titled, “How to Prevent a Cyberwar,” begins by admitting the very pretext the US is using to expand its control over cyberwarfare is baseless, noting that “specifics of Russia’s interference in the 2016 America election remain unclear.”
Regardless, Cohen continues by laying out a plan for reasserting American control over cyberwarfare anyway, by claiming:
Cyberweapons won’t go away and their spread can’t be controlled. Instead, as we’ve done for other destructive technologies, the world needs to establish a set of principles to determine the proper conduct of governments regarding cyberconflict. They would dictate how to properly attribute cyberattacks, so that we know with confidence who is responsible, and they would guide how countries should respond.
Cohen, unsurprisingly, nominates the US to lead and direct these efforts:
The United States is uniquely positioned to lead this effort and point the world toward a goal of an enforceable cyberwarfare treaty. Many of the institutions that would be instrumental in informing these principles are based in the United States, including research universities and the technology industry. Part of this effort would involve leading by example, and the United States can and should establish itself as a defender of a free and open internet everywhere.
Cohen never explains how this US-dominated framework will differ from existing “international” frameworks regarding conventional warfare the US regularly abuses to justify a growing collection of devastating conflicts it is waging worldwide.
And as has been repeatedly documented, the United States’ definition of a “free and open internet everywhere” is an Internet dominated by US tech companies seeking to enhance and expand US interests globally.
Cohen ironically notes that:
Cyberweapons have already been used by governments to interfere with elections, steal billions of dollars, harm critical infrastructure, censor the press, manipulate public conversations about crucial issues and harass dissidents and journalists. The intensity of cyberconflict around the world is increasing, and the tools are becoming cheaper and more readily available.
Indeed, cyberweapons have already been used, primarily by the United States.
Jared Cohen himself was directly involved in joint operations between Google, Facebook, the US State Department and a number of other US tech and media enterprises which before and during 2011 set the stage for the so-called “Arab Spring.”
It included the training, funding and equipping of activists years ahead of the the uprisings as well as active participation in the uprisings themselves, including providing assistance to both protesters and militants everywhere from Libya to Syria in overthrowing governments targeted by Washington for regime change.
One such tool used in these efforts was described in a UK Independent article titled, “Google planned to help Syrian rebels bring down Assad regime, leaked Hillary Clinton emails claim,” which would report that:
An interactive tool created by Google was designed to encourage Syrian rebels and help bring down the Assad regime, Hillary Clinton’s leaked emails have reportedly revealed. By tracking and mapping defections within the Syrian leadership, it was reportedly designed to encourage more people to defect and ‘give confidence’ to the rebel opposition.
The article would continue, mentioning Jared Cohen by name:
The email detailing Google’s defection tracker purportedly came from Jared Cohen, a Clinton advisor until 2010 and now-President of Jigsaw, formerly known as Google Ideas, the company’s New York-based policy think tank. FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad) In a July 2012 email to members of Clinton’s team, which the WikiLeaks release alleges was later forwarded to the Secretary of State herself, Cohen reportedly said: “My team is planning to launch a tool on Sunday that will publicly track and map the defections in Syria and which parts of the government they are coming from.”
Would Cohen’s more recently proposed “framework” have prevented the United States’ use of these cyberweapons against sovereign states to undermine sociopolitical stability, overturn entire governments and plunge them into enduring chaos many still remain in 6 years later? Most likely not.
What Cohen and the interests he represents are truly concerned with is that nations are now not only able to recognize, prepare for and defend against US cyberwarfare, they may be capable of retaliating against the US.
Cohen’s proposal for an international framework to govern cyberwarfare simply seeks to define it in terms that leaves the US with both an uncontested monopoly over cyberwarfare as well as the means to wield it globally with absolute impunity.
It would be not unlike current “international” frameworks used to govern conflicts between nations which the US has used to justify an expansive, global campaign of extraterritorial war stretching from North Africa to Central Asia and beyond.
Such frameworks have become enablers of injustice, not a deterrence to it.
As nations from Iran to North Korea are discovering, the only true means of defending oneself from foreign military aggression is creating a plausible deterrence to dissuade foreign nations from attacking. This is done by creating a price for attacking and invading that is higher than the perceived benefits of doing so.
Nations like Russia and China have already achieved this balance with the United States in terms of conventional and nuclear warfare, and have now nearly established a similar deterrence in terms of cyber and information warfare. For the rest of the world, developing cyberdefense is not as costly as conventional military or nuclear arsenals, making cyberwarfare a corner of the battlefield unlikely to be monopolized by the US as it had done at the turn of the century.
Ensuring that no single nation ever has the opportunity to abuse such a monopoly again means exposing and confronting efforts by those like Google’s Jared Cohen and his proposal for an “international framework” for cyberwarfare that resembles the same sort of enabling the United Nations provides the US in terms of proliferating conventional conflicts across the globe.

http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/north-koreans-process-salmon-snow-crab-eaten-us-50296174,"North Koreans process salmon, snow crab eaten in US, Europe","Americans buying seafood for dinner may inadvertently have subsidized the North Korean government as it builds its nuclear weapons program, an Associated Press investigation has found. Their purchases may also have supported forced labor.
At a time when North Korea is banned from selling almost anything, the country is sending tens of thousands of workers worldwide to bring in an estimated $200 million to $500 million a year. That could account for a sizable portion of North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programs, which South Korea says have cost more than $1 billion.
While North Korean workers have been documented overseas, the AP investigation reveals that some products they make go to the United States. AP also tracked products made by North Korean workers to Canada, Germany and elsewhere in the European Union.
In response to the investigation, Senate leaders said Wednesday that the U.S. needs to keep products made by North Koreans out and get China to refuse to hire North Korean workers.
""The (Trump) administration needs to ramp up the pressure on China to crack down on trade with North Korea across the board,"" said top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer.
At Chinese factories, North Korean workers aren't allowed to leave their compounds without permission, and must step from housing to factories in pairs or groups, with North Korean minders. They receive a fraction of their salaries, while the rest — as much as 70 percent — is taken by the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's government.
John Connelly, president of the National Fisheries Institute, urged its 300 members, including the largest seafood importers in the U.S., to ""ensure that wages go to the workers, and are not siphoned off to support a dangerous dictator.""
Besides seafood, AP found North Korean laborers making wood flooring and sewing garments in Chinese factories. Those industries also export to the U.S., but AP did not track specific shipments except for seafood.
American companies aren't allowed to import products made by North Korean workers anywhere in the world, and companies doing business with them could face criminal charges for using North Korean workers or materially benefiting from their work. (The AP employs a small number of support staff in its Pyongyang bureau under a waiver granted by the U.S. government to allow the flow of news and information.)
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, responsible for enforcing the law, did not respond to requests for comment.
""This is a state-sponsored scheme to export folks who are in bonded labor,"" said Luis CdeBaca, former U.S. ambassador for human trafficking issues. ""It's supporting a repressive regime.""
Western companies involved that responded to AP said forced labor and potential support for North Korea was unacceptable in their supply chains. They said they'd investigate, and some said they'd already cut off ties with suppliers.
Meanwhile, as many as 100,000 North Koreans continue to work in construction in the Gulf states, shipbuilding in Poland, logging in Russia and on fishing boats in Uruguay. New U.N. sanctions bar countries from expanding their North Korean workforce. Despite the pay and restrictions, the jobs abroad are highly coveted among North Koreans.
Roughly 3,000 North Koreans are believed to work in Hunchun, a Chinese industrial hub near the North Korean and Russian borders.
At some factories, laborers work hunched over tables as North Korean political slogans blasted from loudspeakers. When a reporter approached a group of North Koreans — women in tight, bright polyester clothes preparing a meal at a garment factory — one confirmed that she and some others were from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. Then a minder arrived, ordering: ""Don't talk to him!""
It's unknown what conditions are like in every factory, but AP reporters saw North Korean laborers living and working in several facilities, including joint venture Hunchun Dongyang Seafood Industry & Trade Co. Ltd. & Hunchun Pagoda Industry Co. Ltd., distributed globally by Ocean One Enterprise; Yantai Dachen Hunchun Seafood Products, and Yanbian Shenghai Industry & Trade Co. Ltd.
They're getting their seafood from China, Russia and the U.S.
Despite AP seeing North Korean workers, Hunchun Dongyang's manager Zhu Qizhen denied that they hire them and refused to give details. The other Chinese companies didn't comment.
Shipping records show more than 100 cargo containers of seafood were sent to the U.S. and Canada this year from the factories where North Koreans were working in China, including packages of snow crab, salmon fillets and squid rings.
One importer, The Fishin' Company in Munhall, Penn., said it cut ties with Hunchun processors and got its last shipment this summer. Seafood can remain in the supply chain for more than a year.
Often the fish arrives in generic packaging. But some were already branded in China with familiar names like Walmart or Sea Queen, which is sold exclusively at ALDI supermarkets. There's no way to say where a particular package ends up, nor what percentage of a factory's products wind up in the U.S.
Walmart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said company officials banned their suppliers from getting seafood processed at a Hunchun plant a year ago after an audit revealed potential issues with migrant workers.
""Combatting forced labor is a complex problem that no one company, industry, or government can tackle alone,"" she said.
ALDI did not comment.
Some U.S. companies had indirect ties to North Korean laborers in Hunchun. Customs records indicate that Chicken of the Sea, owned by Thai Union, did business with sister companies of the Hunchun factories in another part of China. Thai Union said the sister company they do business with meets all of their fair labor standards, and should not be penalized just because they have the same owner.
Boxes at the factories also had markings from several major German supermarket chains and brands. REWE Group, which owns REWE markets and the Penny chain, said their contract has expired with Hunchun Dongyang. All the companies that responded said suppliers were forbidden to use forced labor. Shipments also went to two Canadian importers, Morgan Foods and Alliance Seafood, which did not respond to requests for comment about who processes their seafood in China.
As the late summer chill set in one evening, a dozen or so women from Hunchun Pagoda played volleyball in the quiet road in front of the compound's gate.
A train horn blew. The women shouted to one another. A car with a foreigner drove by. One laughingly called out: ""Bye-bye!""

The Las Vegas Police Department on Friday released a video that would appear to debunk NFL national anthem protest ringleader Michael Bennett’s claim that he was racially profiled during an arrest in August. Bennett was in Sin City attending the Mayweather-McGregor title bout and afterward, went to a club where what a call to investigate a possible shooting resulted in police being sent to the scene. Upon their arrival, the Seattle Seahawks $31.5 million defensive lineman and social justice activist was deemed to be acting suspiciously – hiding behind a machine and taking flight – which resulted in him being briefly detained by officers. Bennett claimed that a gun was held to his head and that he was in fear for his life (no video to either confirm or rebut this exists) and that the police used excessive force and that he was the victim of racial profiling. The second accusation was nonsense because there were many blacks at the club at the time of the call although they weren’t acting in a manner that attracted the attention of officers. Sheriff Joe Lombardo defended his officers and rebutted claims of the racial profiling, another video showed that despite his claims, …

But I have a platform and you don’t. Conversation and debate is healthy though. My last Jeter headline was provocative, and you guys pounced on me like I pounced on DJ.

Here’s the latest from Miami Herald:

But here’s what got me next…
“Jeter has not informed manager Don Mattingly if he will be retained, but that is widely expected by members of the organization.”
Now while this line doesn’t say Donnie will be canned… there’s no way of knowing until it happens.
But then that got my mind starting to think about Jeet and the Core Four and the Yankee connection in Miami, if any, and wondering… would long time friend Jorge Posada be a guy that Jeet would hire for that clubhouse? Gerald Williams? Hell… what’s Andy Pettitte doing these days?
I know Jeter wants to impress in Miami, and get a winning team and all of that, but I was annoyed originally when he canned all the former Marlins “icons” and Hall of Famers because for me, that was part of the charm and marketing of the Marlins. Is Jeet gonna replace them with personalities or will it be more old white guys in charge? I wonder if Jorge is coming? I wonder if there is a meaning to his madness.
Who knows… I just find his new job interesting, and it’s strange, but fun to watch.

",A fudged Brexit is May's best hope,"Garvan Walshe is a former policy adviser to the British Conservative Party. He is also the CEO of Brexit Analytics. The opinions in this article belong to the author.
(CNN) In last year's referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union , Theresa May supported remaining in the EU in the quietest way imaginable.
Nearly 16 months on, she still refuses to say whether she has since changed her mind. In an interview with LBC radio presenter (and CNN contributor) Iain Dale, the PM said that she would not ""answer hypothetical questions.""
During the referendum campaign she gave just one public speech and limited her campaigning to photo opportunities for local media. (Photos of the woman who is now Britain's Prime Minister holding up an ""I'm IN"" sign are available on social media, but require some digging to unearth).
This low profile enabled her to win the Conservative Party leadership contest that followed David Cameron's resignation after his referendum defeat. She was the only candidate then acceptable to both the party's ""Leave"" and ""Remain"" wings, and appointed a Cabinet balanced between both.
But she still needed to reassure the euroskeptics: that was the purpose of her infamous soundbite : ""Brexit means Brexit -- and we will make a success of it."" I may have supported remaining in the EU then, she meant, but don't worry, I'm on your side now.
Pushed by her Brexit-supporting adviser Nick Timothy, she set Britain up for adversarial negotiations with Brussels.
The business community's preferred outcome, a so-called ""soft"" Brexit, where the UK left the political structures of the EU, but stayed in economic ones (known as the single market and customs union), was dismissed.
Moderate Cabinet ministers were forced to toe the euroskeptic line. During the campaign for the snap election May called this June, nobody even thought of questioning her pro-Brexit credentials.
Leave voters trusted her: research from the British Election Study shows that the Conservatives picked up five percentage points of support from Leave voters.
Unfortunately for the Tories, her hard line drove Remain-supporting Conservatives away, and her party lost its majority in the House of Commons.
She has since clung on to office, but as the captive, rather than leader of her Cabinet.
Yet now that she must listen to it, it is not so much balanced as it is divided. She's too weak to lead her ministers, but they're too split to make her follow.
Hence the devastating impact of Iain Dale's question about how she would vote if there were another referendum on EU membership. If she had said that she would now vote to leave, she would have to explain why she changed her mind.
JUST WATCHED Emmanuel Macron: Europe needs 'more ambition' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Emmanuel Macron: Europe needs 'more ambition' 04:36
But if she said she would vote to remain, she would confirm growing Brexiteer fears that she -- along with some of her key Cabinet ministers -- didn't really support her government's main policy.
Indeed, her deputy Damian Green (a sincere and passionate pro-European) admitted he'd vote ""remain"" again and thought that Britain would be ""better off"" staying in, but that he had a democratic duty to carry out the instructions of the British people.
All of this leaves Britain in something of a bind.
Remain-supporting members of the Cabinet know that the best hope they have of mitigating disaster is to work from the inside, under the cover of a weak Prime Minister.
If they brought the government down, the Conservative Party's grassroots would pick the most anti-European leader possible. At best, this would waste valuable time (there are only 18 months left to negotiate); at worst, it would cause the negotiations to collapse.
Leave supporters see advantage in having former Remain supporters involved so they can be blamed for the costs imposed when Brexit goes wrong. But they are starting to ask how long they can continue to support a government whose leading figures think its main policy is a disaster to be mitigated, not an achievement to celebrate.
The stability of May's government is based on the willing suspension of disbelief: Leave supporters and former-Remain supporters pretending they mean the same thing when they say they want the ""best Brexit deal.""
But when leavers believe the best deal can be obtained by threatening to walk away from Europe without a deal, while the once remain supporting finance minister warns that ""no deal"" could mean planes would be prevented from flying between Britain and the EU, that suspension is called into question.
It is becoming clear that the government assembled after the June election is not capable of carrying out the revolutionary Brexit that hard line Brexiteers, most of the Tory party's members, and a significant minority of the British public want.
These Brexiteers see their government willingly capitulating to the EU's ""intransigence."" They fear the UK will end up like Norway: forced to accept EU rules without having any say in making them.
Dale's question to the Prime Minister exposed this fundamental fact. If the hardliners want their kind of Brexit, they will have to take back control of the process. Whether the Conservative Party could survive such a Bolshevik Brexit is another matter altogether. But it's becoming increasingly clear that the best May's government could achieve would be a fudged Brexit.",1

(Before It's News)
The tenure of Dave Doeren has been an interesting one at NC State. He was brought in to win games, and in his first 4 seasons it was looking rocky. He was not beating teams that he should have (last year ECU, BC are just 2 of those examples). The fan base was becoming very restless in Raleigh.
The complaints were many, and wide ranging. There was the dismissal of Offensive Coordinator Matt Canada, there was “he lacked personality,” and then there was the no signature wins. No wins against teams that he had less “talent” than. That all ended on Saturday, with the Wolfpack’s victory against Florida State. Now, people will say, that the reason that NC State won is because FSU lost Deonndre Francois. Others will say it was because of the ref’s and some questionable calls (yes, there were some).
Still others will say it was because of the 2 week layoff that the Seminoles had because of Hurricane Irma (this is the only one I’ll give you). Through all of this, Dave Doeren’s team came out and did what it needed to do. The Wolfpack defensive line was dominant, making life hell for FSU’s true freshman quaterback. The offense was balanced rushing the ball 37 times and passing 33 times.
Dave Doeren has been working on all of the things that critics have been throwing at him. If you watched him on The Coaches Room during the National Championship game last season, you saw the personality come out! He was funny and engaging! Dave Doeren needed this game against FSU!
He won against a team that will be a top 25 team at the end of the season! Now all he has to do, is not allow this team to rest on this win and continue carrying on that intensity that they took to Doak Campbell Stadium this past Saturday.

The justices noted that the provision of the travel ban had expired and that the case no longer presents ""a live case or controversy."" The court said it expressed ""no views on the merits"" of the case.
The court did not act, however, on a separate and broader injunction in a related case brought by the state of Hawaii. That case dealt not only with a ban on travel from six Muslim majority countries, but also a ban on refugees.
The court's move to split up the two cases comes after the six-nation travel ban has expired. The refugee ban, however, has not -- it expires on October 24.

(Before It's News)
The Blackhawks preseason came to a close last night, at home, against the Boston Bruins. For those of you that spent your Saturday night at the United Center, I feel for you. It was a boring game. Most of the players seemed uninterested and most roster battles have been decided already. Since I wasn’t even supposed to recap this one, you’ll have to excuse the Cliff Notes version:
The Good
One player who was interested was Corey Crawford. He pitched in a 38 save shutout, and looked ready for the regular season. He was aggressive and square to the puck all night. I am sure that even in a shutout, the meatballs will find a way to complain about him.
The only goal of the game was a powerplay snipe by Patrick Sharp. Shades of the old sharpie at the left circle, before anyone knew just who Artemi Panarin was. Sharp had about 3 inches to score this goal and used every bit of that. For as much angst that the Sharp signing caused me on July 1st, seeing him out there and scoring gives me the chills. He may not be the Sharp of 2013-14, but the team seems to enjoy him being back.
Anton Khudobin was excellent for the Bruins. Any time you lose a game 1-0, it is not on the goalie. This game was a coin flip as to who was going to win.
The Blackhawks won an amazing 65% of their faceoffs, and they were 1-5 on the powerplay.
The Bad
Both Connor Murphy and Jonathan Toews left the game early with minor injuries. Quenneville said after the game that they “ Should be alright “.
“. No one really stood out. Not even “the amazing” Alex Debrincat. Jan Rutta continued to look good, but even he had some issues. Speaking of Debrincat, I said earlier that I understand them keeping him on the roster, but that doesn’t mean I think that he’s going to make it more than 10 games before he runs head first into the NHL wall.
The Ugly
The Bruins looked like they had tied the game almost midway through the third period, but Jake Debrusk interfered with Corey Crawford’s ability to make the stop and the goal was negated. Honestly, Crawford wasn’t making the save on the clean backdoor chance from Jakob Forsbacka Karlsson( say that name 5 times quickly ), anyway.
), anyway. I still see no redeeming qualities in Lance Bouma. He’s probably going to make the team over John Hayden, and that is a damn crime.
The Lineblender
Left Wing – Center – Right Wing
Brandon Saad – Jonathan Toews – Richard Panik
Patrick Sharp – Nick Schmaltz – Patrick Kane

Anonymous is the most famous ‘hacktivist’ group in the world. The informal nature of the group makes its mechanics difficult to define. Subsequently, without a formal organizational hierarchy, it’s difficult to explain Anonymous to the general public and the media. In this article, I’ll explain the history of the group, and offer some clarity on what’s misunderstood about them.
 
‘Hacktivist’ is a portmanteau of ‘hacker’ and ‘activist’. When people have technical skills, have access to the Internet, and understand how network infrastructure and servers work, it can be tempting to put that knowledge into having some effect on the world. The ‘activist’ part of ‘hacktivist’ means that they don’t do their hacking and cracking without a cause.

The various people behind Anonymous worldwide are united in a belief that corporations and organizations they consider to be corrupt should be attacked. If you’re an administrator for a network that has little reason to be a target for social activists, your network and servers are unlikely to become a target for Anonymous.
 
If for some reason you believe your network might become a target, I recommend testing it for handling DDoS attacks, as that’s the most common method Anonymous uses to bring down web servers.
 
Not all of Anonymous’ activities involve attacking networks or websites. Anonymous has also been active in initiating public protests. But the web and IRC channels are the lifeblood of the group. If it weren’t for the Internet, Anonymous would’ve never existed.

With no end in sight to the black player protests against issues that they are unable to articulate beyond platitudes to Colin Kaepernick and opposition to President Trump, the NFL is reportedly working to find a way to accommodate the malcontents. As was previously reported, four Kaepernick allies sent a letter to the league office calling for the NFL to set aside an entire month for social justice (translation: anti-police, anti-white, anti-America) promotions along the lines of Breast Cancer Month. While at first, it would be easy to dismiss such a letter, considering that troublemaker Michael Bennett – a man who lied about the Las Vegas Police and racial profiling – was behind it but that was before the NFL and its commissioner picked sides in the culture war. Now such a period for the promotion of a Black Lives Matter style of agenda appears to be closer to fruition as league poohbahs, player’s union honchos and race-obsessed players are engaging in a quiet series of meetings.

","Donald Trump Threatens North Korea On Twitter, NK Foreign Minister Responds ""You Declared War""","By Aaron Kesel
Tensions are rising at a quickening rate between the United States and North Korea as for weeks U.S. president Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un have exchanged insults, but things are heating up as the world gears for conflict. On Monday, North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho accused President Donald Trump of declaring war, adding the country now has the right to shoot down U.S. strategic bombers even when they are not inside the country’s airspace, The Guardian reported.
“The whole world should clearly remember it was the U.S. who first declared war on our country,” Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said. “Since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to make countermeasures, including the right to shoot down United States strategic bombers even when they are not inside the airspace border of our country,” he added.
This comes after U.S. president Donald Trump’s tirade at the UN where he essentially declared war on North Korea and Iran as he flung around harsh rhetoric threatening both nations. The U.S. will have “no choice but to totally destroy North Korea if it is forced to defend itself or its allies,” Trump said at the UN.
Trump then took to Twitter on Saturday night after a coordinated joint military drill with Japan flying B-1B bombers from Guam and F-15 fighter escorts from Okinawa, over the waters of North Korea.
The North Korean regime “won’t be around much longer” if Ri “echoes thoughts” of dictator Kim Jong-un, whom Trump has nicknamed “Little Rocket Man,” POTUS tweeted.
Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won’t be around much longer! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017
Ri called Trump “President Evil” and claimed that economic sanctions will not deter Pyongyang’s pursuit of nuclear weapons and a “balance of power with the U.S.”
Ri said on Monday, the UN and the international community had hoped that the exchange of rhetoric between the two countries would not turn into “real action.”
“However, last weekend Trump claimed that our leadership won’t be around much longer, and hence, at last, he declared war on our country,” Ri said. Adding: “Given the fact that this came from someone who holds the seat of the US presidency, this is clearly a declaration of war,” Ri said.
The U.S. denies it has declared war but warned it had military options if North Korea takes further “provocative” actions.
“Frankly, the suggestion of that is absurd,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. “Our goal is still the same: we continue to seek the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” she said. “That’s our focus – doing that through both the most maximum economic and diplomatic pressures as possible at this point.”
Meanwhile, the Pentagon stated it had the right to fly aircraft off the North Korean coast and would continue doing so. Col Robert Manning, a Defense Department spokesman said that the U.S. had weighed military options in confronting the threat of North Korea.
The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad) “If North Korea does not stop their provocative actions … we will make sure that we provide options to the president to deal with North Korea,” Manning said.
The PBoC (People’s Bank of China) central bank of China — North Korea’s only major ally — has also told its banks to “strictly implement the U.N. sanctions” as a move to stop the development of its nuclear weapon program.
According to Reuters via RIA news agency, Russia is reportedly working behind the scenes to resolve the diplomatic crisis with a political solution between the two nations. Russia is warning that a conflict on the Korean peninsula would have “catastrophic consequences” for the world as a whole.
Last week U.S. Secretary Of Defense threatened the potential use of “kinetic weapons” on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) if things continue; this came before the flyover of North Korea after the U.S. and South Korea’s annual harass-the-dictatorship Ulchi-Freedom Guardian drills. With a single tweet, the president of the United States could start a war, someone needs to take Twitter away from Trump if it’s not clear by now it’s an absolute national security risk.

",Adding Words To Syrian Witness' Statement To Fit Western Narrative,"By Brandon Turbeville
Although the entirety of the Western corporate media machine is worthy of the name “Fake News,” CNN has become the standard bearer of the title. It seems that the organization is doing everything in its power to earn its position as the tip of the spear in the army of “fake news.” Indeed, it is scarcely possible to keep up with the lies, deceit, and half-truths CNN presents to the general public on a daily basis. Occasionally, however, one instance stands out so much that it cannot be allowed to slip by without being addressed.
Back in 2016, as Aleppo was the scene of a fierce battle between America’s terrorist forces and the Syrian military, CNN broadcasted a report from Jibrin, Syria where it purported to show the sad state of civilians fleeing the war that had come to Aleppo. The clip shows two Syrians – one young boy and an older man – who are telling the reporter about their situation.
The CNN reporter predictably attributes the horrors facing the civilians as a result of the eastern part of Aleppo “being under siege by the Syrian military,” not the fact that terrorists had seized east Aleppo and were fighting to the death to keep it. Still he quotes an older man who paints a less than typical CNN-style portrayal of the “rebels.” The man says, “I wanted to leave with my kids fifteen days ago but the rebels shot at me and said ‘Hey you bastard! Do you want to join the regime?’”
The only thing surprising about the man’s statement was that it was actually aired on CNN.
However, the most interesting aspect of the report is what was attributed to the young boy whom CNN quotes as saying, “We were afraid that we would starve to death. We were also scared because heavy bombs were falling.”
This quote makes the boy seem as if he is worried because of the Syrian military’s bombs. However, the translation is not only inaccurate, the second half is completely fabricated. The boy’s actual statement is “We were afraid that we would starve to death. We were afraid that we would starve to death.” Even to a non-Arabic speaker, one can clearly hear that the boy is merely repeating his first statement a second time. He says nothing about bombs. CNN simply added it to the translation for political and propaganda purposes.
While civilians on the ground were no doubt worried about the bombs of the Syrian military (bombs kill regardless of who drops them) they were even more afraid of living under the unimaginable tyranny of America’s terrorists. Still, CNN has gone much further than simply bending the truth to fit a narrative, it has obviously told a complete and total lie. It has put words in the mouths of its interview subjects and passed it off as the truth. At best, this is a violation of journalistic ethics. More realistic, however, it is an act of willful deceit and an attempt to mold the minds of the general public for political purposes.
At this point, CNN cannot be taken seriously as even a second rate news organization. It is clearly nothing more than a propaganda mouthpiece for State Department and other interests. Unfortunately for CNN, even operating as a propaganda organ, it is only second rate.

The Chicago Bears will face their biggest rival, the Green Bay Packers, at Lambeau Field this Thursday night in Green Bay. The following is a quick review of the injury report for both the Bears and Packers and what each injury means to both teams.
Chicago Bears
Tom Compton-OT/G-Compton practiced in full on Monday and appears to be ready for the game. The Bears may need his services Thursday.
Quintin Demps-SS-He will be out with a broken forearm for this and the next few games. Adrian Amos, last year’s starter at free safety, will take his place.
Hroniss Grasu-C-Grasu has been limited in practice all week with a hand injury and is questionable for tonight’s game. If he is out, that tightens up the depth at the center position and may force some reshuffling.
Nick Kwiatkoski-LB-After tearing his pectoral muscle against the Buccaneers, he won’t be available for this game leaving Christian Jones and John Timu to man his position. Hopefully, they will be able to continue to step up.
Josh Sitton-RG-Sitton did not play in last week’s game and was limited in practice this week with a rib injury. Consider him a game-time decision that could cause some reshuffling on the offensive line for the second week in a row.
Akiem Hicks-DE-Hicks was just added to the injury report with a foot injury and is listed as questionable. Hopefully, he plays because the Bears need his leadership and pass rush ability tonight. With Aaron Rodgers being one of the most mobile quarterbacks in the league, getting a lot of a pass pressure on him and getting him down is a must.
Overall, surprisingly, the Bears aren’t as banged too terribly but the possibility of having Hicks out is concerning. Hopefully, he will be able to play.
Green Bay Packers
Davon House-CB-House will be out of the lineup with a quad injury tonight. House, the Packers starter at left corner, will be missed. This means that Quintin Rollins will likely have to step in and play tonight.
David Bakhtiari-OT– After a week of limited participation in practice, he is listed as doubtful with a hamstring injury going into the game tonight. Should he not be able to play, Adam Pankey will take his place.
Bryan Bulaga-OT-Bulaga, the tackle opposite Bakhtiari, is also listed as doubtful and will probably be out for Thursday’s game. Having both of their offensive tackles out tonight is not good for Green Bay. Hopefully, Chicago’s pass rush will be able to take advantage of this and get a lot of pass pressure on Rodgers. If Bulaga can’t play then the Packers will have to do some switching around to make things work.
Mike Daniels-DT-Daniels has a hip injury and has been limited in practice all week. It’s not known yet if he will play and if he can’t then Montravious Adams should take his place.
Nick Perry-LB-Perry enters the game as questionable but practiced in full after starting the week limited. It appears as if he is a go but if he can’t go then Kyler Fackrell will get the starting nod.
The Packers had five other players who started out the week limited in practice but ended it with no limitations. They were:
Safety Kentrell Rice with a groin injury.
Wide receiver Randall Cobb with a chest injury.
Running back Ty Montgomery with a wrist injury.
Linebacker Jake Ryan with a hamstring and a concussion issue.
Defensive tackle Quinton Dial with a chest injury.
Green Bay may have some critical pieces of their offensive line missing in this game so Chicago needs to take advantage of that. They need to rush Rodgers, contain him and not let him make plays with his feet. That will be easier with Bulaga and Bakhtiari out.
Hopefully, that will help even things up a little bit.
Score Prediction: Green Bay 21 Chicago 17

http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/05/health/why-women-cheat-partner/index.html; http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/05/health/why-women-cheat-partner/index.html,The changing reasons why women cheat on their husbands,"One of the more interesting facts in Esther Perel's new book, State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity , comes near the beginning.
Since 1990, notes the psychoanalyst and writer, the rate of married women who report they've been unfaithful has increased by 40 percent, while the rate among men has remained the same.
More women than ever are cheating, she tells us, or are willing to admit that they are cheating -- and while Perel spends much of her book examining the psychological meaning, motivation, and impact of these affairs, she offers little insight into the significance of the rise itself.
So what exactly is happening inside marriages to shift the numbers? What has changed about monogamy or family life in the past 27 years to account for the closing gap? And why have so many women begun to feel entitled to the kind of behavior long accepted (albeit disapprovingly) as a male prerogative?
These questions first occurred to me a few years ago when I began to wonder how many of my friends were actually faithful to their husbands.
From a distance, they seemed happy enough, or at least content. Like me, they were doing the family thing. They had cute kids, mortgages, busy social lives, matching sets of dishes. On the surface, their husbands were reasonable, the marriages modern and equitable. If these women friends were angry unfulfilled or resentful, they didn't show it.
Then one day, one of them confided in me she'd been having two overlapping affairs over the course of five years.
Almost before I'd finished processing this, another friend told me she was 100 percent faithful to her husband, except when she was out of town for work each month. Not long after, another told me that while she'd never had sex with another man, she'd had so many emotional affairs and inappropriate email correspondences over the years that she'd had to buy a separate hard drive to store them all.
What surprised me most about these conversations was not that my friends were cheating, but that many of them were so nonchalant in the way they described their extramarital adventures. There was deception but little secrecy or shame.
Often, they loved their husbands, but felt in some fundamental way that their needs (sexual, emotional, psychological) were not being met inside the marriage. Some even wondered if their husbands knew about their infidelity, choosing to look away.
""The fact is,"" one of these friends told me, ""I'm nicer to my husband when I have something special going on that's just for me."" She found that she was kinder, more patient, less resentful, ""less of a bitch."" It occurred to me as I listened that these women were describing infidelity not as a transgression but a creative or even subversive act, a protest against an institution they'd come to experience as suffocating or oppressive.
In an earlier generation, this might have taken the form of separation or divorce, but now, it seemed, more and more women were unwilling to abandon the marriages and families they'd built over years or decades. They were also unwilling to bear the stigma of a publicly open marriage or to go through the effort of negotiating such a complex arrangement.
These women were turning to infidelity not as a way to explode a marriage, but as a way to stay in it. Whereas conventional narratives of female infidelity so often posit the unfaithful woman as a passive party, the women I talked to seemed in control of their own transgressions. There seemed to be something new about this approach.
In The Secret Life of the Cheating Wife: Power, Pragmatism, and Pleasure in Women's Infidelity , another book on infidelity to be published this November, the sociologist Alicia Walker elaborates on the concept of female infidelity as a subversion of traditional gender roles.
To do so, she interviews 40 women who sought or participated in extramarital relationships through the Ashley Madison dating site.
Like The State of Affairs, Walker's text offers valuable insight simply by way of approaching its subject from a position of curiosity as opposed to prevention or recovery, and she investigates which factors led the women in her study to go outside their marriages.
Surely, one might think, a woman who would do such a thing must be acting out of a desire to escape a miserable marriage. And yet it turns out, this isn't always the case: Many of the women Walker interviewed were in marriages that were functional. Like the women I knew who cheated, many of the interviewees said they liked their husbands well enough. They had property together. They had friendships together. They had children that they were working together to raise.
But at the same time, they found married life incredibly dull and constraining and resented the fact that as women, they felt they consistently did a disproportionate amount of the invisible labor that went into maintaining their lifestyle.
One woman in Walker's book told her, ""The inequality of it all is such an annoying factor that I am usually in a bad mood when my spouse is in my presence,"" and another said that while her husband was a competent adult in the world, at home he felt like ""another child to clean up after.""
Many of the friends I spoke to expressed similar feelings. ""I shop and cook, my husband does dishes and empties the trash,"" one told me. ""We each do our own laundry. But I've always been in charge of the 'calendar,' and what I didn't realize until recently is that in some way I'm in charge of managing many of our relationships.
My husband is a homebody and I initiate/plan almost all of our social endeavors. My mom got this phrase from her therapist: 'keeping the pulse of the household' -- this idea that someone has to be managing the emotional heart of your tiny community. I think women do that a lot.""
And as Perel repeats frequently in this book, and in her previous one, little does as much to muffle erotic desire as this kind of caretaking and enmeshment.
""I think there's an incredible amount of deep resentment for women in America about divisions of labor,"" said sociologist Lisa Wade when I asked her to comment on this contradiction. ""And what social scientists are finding now is that there is a correlation between equal division of labor and better sex.""
No matter how much attention is paid to these issues, she told me, ""these kind of cultural beliefs hang on a long time after they're relevant. They hang on in ways that are often invisible. A lot of women have tried to address these problems and have faced a lot of stubbornness from husbands. They feel there's no way to win this battle. So maybe now what women are deciding is that infidelity is a third way.""
Of course, it's a ""third way"" that is not feasible for everyone, even if more women are taking it up, usually women who feel financially secure and independent enough to risk potential fallout. These women seem to be finding that no amount of sensitivity or goodwill on the part of their husbands can save them from the fact that in every arena, from work to marriage to parenthood, they're always doing more for less.
As Wade put it, ""It's such a precarious balance keeping everyone happy, that for many women, to start a long conversation about her own sexual satisfaction seems like a bad idea. We now tell women that they can have it all, that they can work and have a family and deserve to be sexually satisfied. And then when having it all is miserable and overwhelming or they realize marriage isn't all it's cracked it up to be, maybe having affairs is the new plan B.""
I tested this idea out on a few of the friends who had confided in me about their affairs, and most of them agreed. Twenty or thirty years ago they might have opted for divorce, because surely there was another man out there who could do better in this role, who could satisfy them completely. But a lot of these women are children of divorce. They lived through the difficulties divorce can create.
""Even now,"" all these years later, one told me, ""Do you know what my most vivid memory of Christmas is? Driving through a blizzard up I-95 in the back of one of their cars, and then they'd pull over on the side of the highway and hand off me and my brother without speaking. That was our Christmas. Why did these people marry in the first place?""
Maybe that's the essential question, the question preceding those Perel explores in her book. Why do women still marry when, if statistics are to be believed, marriage doesn't make them very happy?
I confided in a friend once that, after 15 years of marriage, the institution and the relationship itself continued to mystify me. At the time I married, marriage had felt like a panacea; it was a bond that would provide security, love, friendship, stability, and romance -- the chance to have children and nice dishes, to be introduced as someone's wife. It promised to expand my circle of family and improve my credit score, to tether me to something wholesome and give my life meaning.
Could any single relationship not fall short of such expectations? Maybe these women were on to something -- valuing their marriages for the things it could offer and outsourcing the rest, accepting the distance between the idealization and the actual thing, seeing marriage clearly for what it is and not what we're all told and promised it will be.

My friend told me she felt this way of thinking was the only answer, and the way she'd come to reconcile her feelings about the relationship. She said that she used to compare her marriage to her parents', who always seemed totally in love. ""Until the end of my mom's life they were spooning together every night in a double bed ... not even a queen. But,"" she added, ""they were awful and narcissistic, with very little to give to their children.""
My friend felt she and her husband were much better parents, more involved and attuned to their kids.
""But often,"" she went on, ""it can feel like my husband and I are running a family corporation together and that our emotional intimacy consists of gossiping about our friends and watching Game of Thrones. Sometimes I wonder if when the kids leave I should either (a) have a passionate affair or (b) find another husband. I may do neither, but it seems like (a) is more likely than (b). I don't have any illusions that marrying someone else will make me happy, not anymore.""",1

","Friday: Pirates at Nats, Cole v Strasburg, Lineup, Notes","Friday: Pirates at Nats, Cole v Strasburg, Lineup, Notes
(Before It's News)
Tonight: Pittsburgh at Washington, round two, to begin at 7:05. AT&T SportsNet and 93.7 The Fan will air the game.
Lineup: Adam Frazier 2B, Starling Marte LF, Cutch CF, Josh Bell 1B, David Freese 3B, Gregory Polanco RF, Elias Diaz C, Sean Rodriguez SS, Cole P. Jordy’s knee must have been pretty banged up; his absence shows the bench hole at middle infield, especially with J-Hay out. Hopefully, after an offseason of rest, we’ll get the 2016 S-Rod back to fill it.

Pitchers: Gerrit Cole (12-11, 4.23) and Stephen Strasburg (14-4, 2.68) are the gunslingers. It may be a meaningless game for the standings, but it’s tough not be juiced up over a Cole v Strasberg head-to-head. Gerrit is making his career-high 33rd start of the season and should break the 200 IP mark for the second time. It’s been a roller coaster season for Cole Train. He’s dropped his last two road games and has given up 31 home runs (amazingly, he had never given up more than 11 in a season until this year), which is one shy of the club record of 32 allowed by Murry Dickson in 1951. Cole is finishing up on a winning note, going 9-5 over his last 19 starts. He’s 3-1/2.56 in five career starts against the Nats and won a 6-1 decision in May in his only 2017 outing. The Nats are giving Stephen an extra day or two between starts to preserve his arm for the money games. Strasburg is still one of the elites with 10.5 K/nine, a 1.038 WHIP, and the rest of his peripherals equally shiny. He has a win over the Bucs this year, though it wasn’t one of his better outings (six IP, three ER), when he took an 8-4 count over Chad Kuhl.
Notes:
Starling Marte extended his hitting streak to nine games with a 2-for-4 performance last night.

Bryce Harper should be available for the rest of the series after missing yesterday’s game w/hyperextended knee.
Love that dirty water: The Bucs have gone 29-49 on the road this season, having lost six in a row and 12 of their last 13. The club hasn’t won back-to-back games away from PNC Park since late August. Pittsburgh posted a 40-41 record on the road last season.
Pete Mackanin will not return as Phils manager next year; he’s being kicked upstairs to serve as a special assistant to the GM. Mac managed the Pirate farm clubs Hickory Crawdads and Lynchburg Hillcats in 2001 and 2002, then became Lloyd McClendon’s bench coach for the for the 2003 season. After Lloyd was fired, Mackanin served as the Pirates’ interim manager for the last month of 2005 and spent the next season managing at Bradenton before moving on in 2007.

",Brazil's Meirelles has hired media team ahead of 2018 election: sources,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles has hired social media experts to boost his image ahead of the 2018 election, three sources told Reuters on Wednesday, the strongest sign yet that the former banker is seriously eyeing a run for president.
Meirelles hired analysts linked to the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) think tank to study his social media presence on a daily basis and build a communication plan, said one of the sources. The sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.
They have been working for Meirelles for more than three months, two of the sources said.
The Finance Ministry’s press office declined comment on Meirelles behalf.
The finance minister’s potential candidacy adds to political uncertainty ahead of a presidential election marked by a strong anti-establishment climate and a lack of clear favorites.
Meirelles, praised by investors for leading a market-friendly agenda of economic reforms, would have to leave his post by April, six months before the election, and could face a wide field of competitive candidates in a first-round vote.
One of the analysts hired by Meirelles works alongside the ministry’s official communication team in Brasilia, although the FGV team has not received any public funds for supporting his potential candidacy, two of the sources said.
The team includes Thomas Traumann, a former spokesman for impeached President Dilma Rousseff, according one of the sources and another person familiar with the matter.
Traumann confirmed to Reuters that he had consulted for Meirelles under private contract since 2015, but he did not work for the Finance Ministry. He declined to comment on potential preparations for next year’s presidential race.
The Finance Ministry said FGV has offered consultancy on social media to the ministry as part of a 40-year-long initiative of institutional support, without any connection to the 2018 campaign.
A ministry spokeswoman, who asked not to be named in accordance with ministry policy, said it had no relationship with Traumann.
FGV said it had not signed a contract with the Finance Ministry or Meirelles.
Reuters reported late in August, citing a source close to Meirelles, that Meirelles wanted to run for president but knew he would have a strong chance only if the economy improved substantially after two years of recession.
Congressmen from his Social Democratic Party (PSD) last month heard from Meirelles that he felt honored to have his name floated as a potential candidate.
Other potential candidates from within President Michel Temer’s fragmented coalition include the governor of Sao Paulo state, Geraldo Alckmin, and Sao Paulo Mayor Joao Doria.
Meirelles opened a Twitter account in June to publicize his actions as minister and has recently left the door open for a potential candidacy, saying he would take a decision on the race by April. About 2 percent of voters have declared their intention to vote for him, according to a recent Datafolha poll.
A civil engineer by training, Meirelles is the former president of BankBoston, which was eventually acquired by Bank of America Corp, and a former president of Brazil’s central bank.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said on Friday its general counsel, Bruce Sewell, will retire and be succeeded by former Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) executive Katherine Adams, who will take over Apple’s multinational legal battle against Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O).
Adams, who will also be senior vice president of legal and global security, will report to Chief Executive Tim Cook, the company said.
Before joining Honeywell in 2003, Adams was an attorney with Sidley Austin LLP in New York. Earlier, she had served as a clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and for Stephen Breyer, who was then an appeals court judge but later was appointed to the Supreme Court.
Sewell, who has been Apple’s general counsel since 2009, will retire at the end of the year, the company said. Sewell, who came to Apple from Intel Corp (INTC.O), guided Apple through its massive patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) over design patents for the original iPhone, a case that is still simmering nearly six years after it was filed and eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. A U.S. appeals court is currently working to decide the final amount of damages Samsung owes Apple.
In taking the legal reins at Apple, Adams will take over a wide-ranging dispute with Qualcomm over how that chipmaker licenses its technology to Apple. At the heart of the dispute is Qualcomm’s long-held practice of charging a percentage of the total price of iPhones and other Apple devices as a licensing fee for its mobile connectivity patent portfolio.
Apple has sued Qualcomm over that practice in U.S. civil courts as well as 11 foreign jurisdictions. Qualcomm has brought an action against Apple before the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban imports of some iPhones. Qualcomm filed a separate civil lawsuit accusing Apple of infringing the patents at issue in that action.
Qualcomm also faces an antitrust complaint from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In addition, four of Apple’s contract manufacturers have sued Qualcomm on antitrust allegations, and Apple has joined that lawsuit.",1

",Researchers Connect a Human Mind to the Internet for the First Time Ever,"By Jake Anderson
Have you ever thought about whether future humans will live out aspects of their lives online in simulated environments, or even extend their natural lifespans by uploading their minds to a secure cloud ecosystem? It’s been a familiar idea in science fiction for decades. With news that Elon Musk was attempting to build a “neural lace,” the concept of a brain-machine interface (BMI) entered the public lexicon. Now, researchers at Wits University in Johannesburg, South Africa, claim to have linked a human mind to the Internet in real time — a biomedical first.
The project, dubbed the “Brainternet,” required the researchers to gather EEG brainwave signals using only an Emotiv EEG device and a simple Raspberry Pi computer. The experiment allowed the human brain to become an information node in the Internet of Things (IoT).
The experiment’s supervisor, Adam Pantanowitz, described it this way:
Brainternet is a new frontier in brain-computer interface systems. There is a lack of easily understood data about how a human brain works and processes information. Brainternet seeks to simplify a person’s understanding of their own brain and the brains of others. It does this through continuous monitoring of brain activity as well as enabling some interactivity.
Researchers say the project could provide valuable information for future deep learning algorithms and could even assist Musk’s endeavors in creating true BMI. Many futurists believe that as the impact and everyday importance of the Internet grows, it is inevitable that humans will merge the physical world with online virtual environments, ushering in a generation of enhanced augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and a synthesis of the two that some call Mixed Reality.
While the concept of “living” on the Internet may seem remote, we are in many ways already cyborgs dependent on the Web and artificial intelligence. Linking our brains to an online “hive mind” may ultimately prove to be the most efficient way humans can both receive and transmit information, though concerns over surveillance and privacy will likely follow us all the way through the century.

",Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities - 2017,"(Reuters) - The news out of South Korea is dominated by political instability, but inside the country, strong and stable relationships between academia and industry continue to drive economic growth and technological innovation. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.
REUTERS TOP 75
The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.
KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.
Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.
The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.
South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)
Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.
And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.
This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).
The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.
Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

St. Nicholas was born and served as a bishop of what is now the Turkish Mediterranean town of Demre, near Antalya, in the 4th century. He was buried in the area formerly known as Myra, but his bones were believed to have been stolen and taken to the southern Italian town of Bari.
Archaeologists, however, have recently discovered what they think is a temple below the church and now believe his remains may be lying there, Cemil Karabayram, the head of Antalya's Reliefs and Monuments authority, told The Associated Press by telephone.
Archaeologists are looking for a way into the temple without harming the 11th-century Church of St. Nicholas, Karabayram said.
Karabayram said the temple was discovered through geo-radar surveys of the church that were conducted as part of a restoration project.
""It is a temple that is intact, has not been touched but may have been affected by an earthquake,"" he said.
""This is an important find both culturally and for Turkey's tourism,"" Karabayram said.
St. Nicholas was known for his generosity. His legend spread around the world and became interwoven with mythical stories of the gift-giving Santa Claus.
Karabayram said that the bones that were smuggled to Bari may have been the remains of another priest.",1

","In Trailblazing Tokyo Governor, Japan Meets Its Great Disrupter","Whatever she decides, she has injected considerable drama into what originally looked like a rubber-stamp election for Mr. Abe. The prime minister had been hoping to capitalize on tensions over North Korea and the existing opposition’s political weakness to distract from scandals that have threatened to undermine him all summer.
Ms. Koike’s rise through the male-dominated world of Japanese politics comes as other women have recently struggled. This summer, two prominent women — the leader of the opposition Democratic Party and Mr. Abe’s second female defense minister — resigned, raising questions about the persistence of the glass ceiling.
By founding a new party that could threaten Mr. Abe’s governing Liberal Democrats, Ms. Koike could upset a political order in which one party has dominated for most of Japan’s postwar era. But while some analysts have labeled Ms. Koike a populist, it is not clear whether she can tap into the kind of support that carried Donald J. Trump to the presidency in the United States.
Just hours before Mr. Abe called late last month for the early election, Ms. Koike unveiled her new party — Kibou no To, or Party of Hope — calling it a “reformist, conservative” alternative to “vested interests.”
Her announcement set off a cascade of political dominoes: the opposition Democratic Party first offered to free all of its candidates to run under Ms. Koike’s umbrella, but after she said she would submit them to a litmus test, the left-wing branch of the Democrats formed yet another new party.
“This is an unprecedented level of disruption in Japanese politics,” said Tomoaki Iwai, a professor of politics at Nihon University in Tokyo.
If Ms. Koike decides to run and her party wins a majority, she could end up as prime minister. But even if the Party of Hope does not become the governing party, it could cut into the Liberal Democrats’ commanding majority, which could dash Mr. Abe’s hopes of running for a third consecutive term as leader of the Liberal Democrats and becoming Japan’s longest-serving prime minister.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
As governor, Ms. Koike has proved brilliant at keeping media attention trained on her, commanding respect in crisp, bright suits in a sea of black-suited men.
In Tokyo’s metropolitan elections in July, she founded an upstart local party that fielded 50 candidates, all but one of whom won seats in the local assembly. Mr. Abe’s Liberal Democrats won less than half as many.
In introducing the national party, Ms. Koike, who is hawkish on security and supports Mr. Abe’s efforts to revise the pacifist Constitution, sought to differentiate it from the governing party by declaring she wanted to eliminate nuclear power in Japan. Mr. Abe has supported the restart of nuclear plants that were shut down after the Fukushima disaster triggered by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011.
Within days of forming the Party of Hope last month, Ms. Koike saw surging support. A Kyodo News poll a week after the announcement showed that 33 percent of respondents wanted Ms. Koike as prime minister, 13 points behind Mr. Abe.
But subsequent polls have exposed more ambivalence. With Ms. Koike so new to her job as governor, close to 80 percent of those surveyed by The Asahi Shimbun, a left-leaning newspaper, said she should remain in that post.
“You know the Japanese proverb saying, ‘If you chase after two rabbits, you won’t catch either?’ ” said Keiko Inokiri, 61, a homemaker interviewed Friday in the Sumida neighborhood of Tokyo. “If she had accomplished something as the Tokyo governor, I might have supported her, but seriously she has done nothing at all.”

As governor, Ms. Koike has focused mainly on preparing for the 2020 Olympics in the city, as well as postponing a planned move of the famed Tsukiji fish market — one of Tokyo’s most popular tourist attractions — because of concerns about a new site where contaminants were discovered in the groundwater.
But she has done little to rein in construction costs for the Olympics, and after several months of study, she decided to split the fish market, moving wholesale operations while renovating the old site so its restaurants and shops could remain for tourists.
Some analysts say Ms. Koike made the best of the circumstances she inherited from her predecessors. But others say she has not run the kind of open government she promised.

“She initially criticized the L.D.P. for being a black box,” said Yu Uchiyama, a professor of politics at the University of Tokyo. “But actually she herself is very closed.”
Last week, two members of Ms. Koike’s local party resigned, including a close ally who characterized her management style as “dictatorial.”
Analysts say such critiques could be tinged by sexism. “We don’t expect women would just be so power-hungry,” said Mari Miura, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo. “There is a double standard, definitely.”
Several analysts described Ms. Koike’s national platform as populist. In addition to her antinuclear stance, she has proposed freezing a planned sales tax increase, eliminating corporate political donations, banning public smoking and reducing waiting lists for nursery schools.
Critics say she has seized on popular slogans without presenting a coherent leadership vision.
“Every policy is cherry-picked based upon public feeling,” said Lully Miura, a lecturer on international politics at Tokyo University. “I don’t think she has any real political theory or philosophy.”
On social media, critics poked fun at Ms. Koike’s reputation for political slipperiness. Twitter users posted doctored images of a popular brand of instant noodles, known as Green Tanuki Soba, with a picture of Ms. Koike. The tanuki — or raccoon dog — is considered a master of shape-shifting in Japanese folklore. “Increasingly dubious, lip service, irresponsible, blatant lies,” read one of the fake labels.
As governor, Ms. Koike has played down ideology. But with her re-entry into national politics, she has asserted her conservative credentials.
When members of the Democratic Party asked to join her new party, she said she would admit only those who supported several principles, including a revision of the pacifist Constitution, Japan’s right to participate in overseas combat missions led by allies and discouraging local governments from allowing permanent residents of foreign descent to vote in local elections.

Last week, the most liberal members of the Democratic Party formed their own group, the Constitutional Democratic Party. Meanwhile, those who have joined her party may tussle with her over its direction.
“I guarantee the effort to undermine her will be ferocious from here on out,” said Sheila A. Smith, a Japan expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, “because she’s a real contender.”
But that may be the biggest challenge for the Party of Hope. For a party so closely linked to Ms. Koike’s identity, it is difficult to see how well it can fare if she does not run herself.
The short campaign season — by law it lasts just 12 days — favors incumbents. In a country where turnout has hit record lows in recent national elections, some analysts say voters looking over Ms. Koike’s party platform may not see much of a change from Mr. Abe’s status quo.
“It’s kind of old themes that have been put in a blender,” said Tobias Harris, a Japan analyst at Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consultancy based in New York. “So it looks a little different, but the ingredients are actually the same.”",1

Liam Payne, Liam Gallagher, Jessie Ware and Foo Fighters have all been lined up for the first episodes of the BBC's new pop show, Sounds Like Friday Night.
US R&B star Jason Derulo will co-host the first edition on 27 October, as well as singing live in the studio.
Jessie Ware and Charlie Puth will also perform, while Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl appears in a filmed sketch.
The show has been described as ""Top of the Pops meets Saturday Night Live"", for its mix of live music and comedy.
BBC Radio 1's Greg James and 1 Xtra's A.Dot will be the regular presenters, with a celebrity guest adding their own twist to the proceedings every week.
The second episode will feature One Direction star Liam Payne as the co-host, with Liam Gallagher and a ""special guest"" completing the line-up.
Image caption Greg James and A.Dot will be joined by a different guest host every week
Broadcast live from Television Centre in London, Sounds Like Friday Night will be the first regular, mainstream music programme on the BBC since Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006.
Produced by James Corden's production company Fulwell 73, it will be broadcast at 19:30 on Friday nights, pitting it against Coronation Street on ITV.
A Question of Sport, which currently airs in that slot, is regularly watched by 2.5 million people - but the BBC hopes that Sounds Like Friday Night will have a long afterlife on iPlayer and YouTube.
In a statement announcing the first show, Derulo, whose hits include Want To Want You and Swalla, said: ""I always have a great time whenever I visit the UK, so I'm super excited to get the weekend party started with a hot new music show.""

",Neck Deep scrap Nottingham show over 'heavy-handed' security,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Neck Deep 'protects fans from heavy-handed' Rock City security
Rock band Neck Deep scrapped their show at Nottingham's Rock City on Monday after what appears to be a physical altercation with security guards.
Gig-goer Rob Jackson told the BBC he saw one guard ""almost body-rolling"" people to the floor after fans started crowd-surfing two songs into the set.
After the band intervened, singer Ben Barlow called the gig off and said ""security had messed it up"".
Rock City said the staff's response ""did not appear disproportionate"".
Nottinghamshire Police said officers ""spoke to the victims"" but ""no arrests had been made"".
""The investigation is ongoing, with a man due to be interviewed in due course,"" added a police spokesman.
More in this story and others from the East Midlands
Mr Jackson, who attended the show with his teenage daughter and her friends, described the scene as a ""ruckus"", and said some band members jumped off stage ""to stop fans getting hurt"" by what he called ""heavy-handed"" security.
""The band jumped in to intervene to stop fans getting hurt, then it turned back on them.""
Georgia Stokes, a student at Nottingham Trent University, who was near the stage, said: ""The staff were being really heavy-handed when people were crowd-surfing, and the band were asking them to stop, because they were trying to protect their fans.
""The lead singer just kept stopping singing and saying 'OK, stop, this isn't cool'.""
'Physical confrontation'
Mr Jackson, from Lincoln, added that fans were ""disappointed but fairly understanding"" when the gig was cancelled.
They continued to chant the song A Part Of Me long after the band explained they would not be returning to the stage.
Barlow later came out to apologise to fans as the venue cleared.
""That's never, ever, ever happened before,"" he said, with his apology captured in a video posted on Twitter.
""We never want to call a show off. I'm so sorry that you guys have paid and that's what happened. I'm really sorry. That's all I can say. I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart. I want to carry on playing the show. I want to be up there now.""
Image copyright Hopeless Records Image caption The rest of the band's UK tour is unaffected
In a statement, Rock City said: ""It appears that the band took exception to the way the Rock City security were handling fans who were crowd-surfing into the pit and attempting to get on stage.
""This unfortunately escalated into a physical confrontation between the band and the security staff.
""Having reviewed the CCTV footage and spoken to witnesses, it doesn't appear that the security staff were disproportionate in their response.
""We know how disappointing this has been for the fans who didn't get to see the band play.""
It added that it was ""fully investigating the incident"" and takes safety ""very seriously"".
Neck Deep told the BBC that the ""events that transpired last night were regretful and deeply unfortunate"".
""Things rapidly escalated to a point that they should never have gotten to. We believe that violence is never a solution, and that everything that went down could and should have been handled better by all parties,"" they said in a statement.
""We are so very sorry to anyone who was in any way hurt, upset or inconvenienced last night.""
The band added that they were hoping to reschedule the show.",1

","Start ‘Em or Sit ‘Em (2017): Week 4: Dak Prescott, Chris Carson, T.Y. Hilton & More","Start ‘Em or Sit ‘Em (2017): Week 4: Dak Prescott, Chris Carson, T.Y. Hilton & More
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Trying to decide who you should start or sit this week? Let’s take a look at a few potential decisions owners have and try to sort through them:
Quarterbacks
Start – Trevor Siemian – Denver Broncos – vs. Oakland
Siemian is a tough quarterback to trust, because the Broncos have always seemed like they wanted Paxton Lynch to take command of the starting role. Then you have a rather poor showing in Week 3, including throwing a pair of INT and having posted a season worst 6.48 yards/attempt. Of course that came on the road, whereas this week he returns home to take on a Raiders’ defense that has allowed the fourth most points per week to opposing quarterbacks (and has yet to get an INT).
A home start against a secondary that doesn’t scare you? It seems like an ideal week to utilize Siemian in your starting lineup. He may not throw for over 300 yards, but the opportunity for TD will be there and that’s vital.
Sit – Dak Prescott – Dallas Cowboys – vs. Los Angeles Rams
The Rams are one of the stingier defenses against opposing quarterbacks thus far. Then you have an offense that is going to run through Ezekiel Elliot and the running game, as evidenced by only 18 passing attempts in Week 3 against Arizona. Of course that seems like the exception to the rule (Prescott had 89 attempts over the first two weeks), except for the fact that Los Angeles has allowed the second most points per week to opposing running backs, thanks to the second most rushing yards (399) and the most rushing TD (5). It’s hard not to expect Elliot to be the focal point of the offense once again, putting Prescott’s performance at risk.
Running Backs
Start – Joe Mixon – Cincinnati Bengals – at Cleveland
The question Mixon has faced is opportunity, but that appeared to resolve itself in Week 3 with a new offensive coordinator running the show:
Joe Mixon – 18 carries for 62 yards, 3 receptions for 39 yards
Jeremy Hill – 7 carries for 23 yards, 1 reception for 6 yards
Giovani Bernard – 3 carries for 37 yards, 2 receptions for 12 yards
Mixon is going to continue to give up some touches to the other two options, but he should continue as the clear leader and possesses the most upside. With things becoming clear, he’s now a must use option.
Start – Chris Carson – Seattle Seahawks – vs. Indianapolis
Much like Mixon, Carson has taken control of the team’s backfield and is the clear leader ahead of Thomas Rawls. With C.J. Prosise out for Week 4, Carson’s role could expand even further and he could see more opportunities in the passing game (4 receptions for 35 yards and 1 TD thus far). Taking on an Indianapolis defense that has allowed 360 yards to opposing running backs through three weeks (201 rushing yards, 159 receiving yards), he could be in line for his biggest week to date.
Sit – Marshawn Lynch – Oakland Raiders – at Denver
While the Broncos have allowed the third fewest rushing yards thus far, the only two teams to allow fewer are the ones who have only played two games (Miami and Tampa Bay). Over three weeks Denver has allowed 142 yards and 0 TD on 58 carries for running backs (2.4 yards per carry), with the “blemish” being running backs who catch the football (105 receiving yards and 1 TD). As it is Lynch is averaging just 3.9 yards per carry, has 1 TD and is not a factor in the passing game. That makes Lynch a tough sell as a RB2, and while you can utilize him as a FLEX he’s a risky proposition at best.
Sit – Mark Ingram – New Orleans Saints – at Miami
The Saints’ backfield remains a bit of a mystery, as Ingram shares things with Adrian Peterson and Alvin Kamara. Ingram has gotten between 11 and 16 touches over the first three weeks, which could be enough to make an impact but it is not a guarantee (he’s averaging around 78 yards per game). The biggest thing is that he has yet to find the end zone, though the fact that his touches are not guaranteed and that the Dolphins are allowing 70 rushing yards per week to opposing running backs makes him a risky play.
Wide Receivers (Two-Receiver Formats)
Start – Golden Tate – Detroit Lions – at Minnesota
It would be easy to overlook Tate in shallower formats, with just 83 total yards over his past two games. That said he’s been targeted at least 11 times in two of the three games this season and he draws a Vikings’ defense that has allowed the second most points per week to opposing wide receivers. With a league high 638 receiving yards allowed, you know Detroit will take to the air and Tate should be the leader of the pack.
Sit – T.Y. Hilton – Indianapolis Colts – at Seattle
Hilton finally had a big day in Week 3, hanging 7 receptions for 153 yards and 1 TD against the Browns. Of course things are likely going to be completely different in Week 4, as the Colts travel to Seattle to take on one of the stronger defenses in the league. We all know the Seahawks’ history and with ample questions hanging over Indianapolis Hilton is going to be a tough sell in shallower formats.
Wide Receivers (Three-Receiver Formats)
Start – Pierre Garcon – San Francisco 49ers – at Arizona
It’s easy to overlook Garcon, as he’s not a flashy option. He is steady, though, and he’s posted strong performances in two of the three games thus far (he has 10 targets and at least 80 yards in two of his three contests). He’s going to remain the team’s top option, and the Cardinals have allowed the third most points per week to opposing wide receivers.
Sit – Jermaine Kearse – New York Jets – vs. Jacksonville
Jacksonville has allowed opponents to turn 48 targets into just 19 receptions, 201 yards and 1 TD. That’s among the best in the league, and while Kearse is the “leader” of the Jets’ receiving corps he’s yet to exceed 64 yards in a game and has gotten 8 targets over the past two weeks. Even in deeper formats he’s impossible to trust.
Tight Ends
Start – Cameron Brate – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New York Giants
The Giants have shown a weakness against opposing tight ends this season, including 3 TD allowed. While Brate has not done much, he has turned 7 targets into 6 receptions and has 1 TD. While he may not be the most trustworthy option, if you don’t have one of the elite he’s as good of a gamble as there is.
Sit – Hunter Henry – Los Angeles Chargers – vs. Philadelphia
There was a lot of hype heading into the season, but Henry hasn’t even been targeted in two of the three games. Will this be another rebound game or will he again be a non-factor in the game plan? It’s impossible to predict, and therefore he can’t be trusted.

",Women's Ashes: Lauren Cheatle & Tahlia McGrath in Australia squad,"Lauren Cheatle is among six uncapped Test players in the squad, along with Tahlia McGrath, Belinda Vakarewa, Beth Mooney, Amanda-Jade Wellington and Ashleigh Gardner
Uncapped pair Lauren Cheatle and Tahlia McGrath have recovered from injury and are in Australia's 15-strong Test squad for the Women's Ashes.
Cheatle, 18, out for six months with a shoulder injury, is fit enough to face England in the multi-format series.
McGrath, 21, played her first match in eight months on October 6 following a stress fracture in pre-season.
Ashleigh Gardner, Belinda Vakarewa, Amanda-Jade Wellington and Beth Mooney are the other uncapped squad members.
Left-arm quick Cheatle and all-rounder Tahlia McGrath are in both the one-day and the Test squads, with the latter set to be reduced to 13 following a three-day pink-ball warm-up against an ACT XI next month.
Fast bowler Vakarewa is the only player named in the Test squad who isn't also in the one-day pool.
Former captain Meg Lanning is missing with a shoulder surgery that will rule her out for up to eight months so the side will be led by 30-year-old batsman Rachael Haynes.
National selector Shawn Flegler said: ""This was a really tough selection process for the panel with some talented players missing out, but we're confident we have selected a balanced side that has the potential to beat England and retain the Ashes.
""This series presents a golden opportunity for the team to reinstate themselves as the number one-ranked side in the world.""
Heather Knight's England will look to regain the Ashes in the multi-format series that begins on 22 October with a one-day international in Brisbane.
Points are awarded across three one-day internationals, one Test and three Twenty20s.

Once the word got out that late-night liberal favorite Jimmy Kimmel was receiving talking points on Obamacare directly from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s office, it became abundantly clear why there is so much anti-Trump material vomited up daily. Late night television has become a propaganda arm of the Democratic party and nothing less. Turn on any channel and you will find some smarmy leftist prick like foul-mouthed Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, the two Jimmies, Bill Maher and others turning their entire programs into anti-Trump diatribes. It used to be that late-night was about entertainment but the same can be said about the NFL. The latest egregious example of how politicized and aligned with the Dems that their Hollywood mouthpieces have become was the complete absence of jokes about Harvey Weinstein, the Democrat megadonor and Hollywood kingpin who is a rainmaker for the Dems.

",Housing Bubble Symmetry,"By Charles Hugh Smith
Housing markets are one itsy-bitsy recession away from a collapse in domestic and foreign demand by marginal buyers.
There are two attractive delusions that are ever-present in financial markets: One is this time it’s different, because of unique conditions that have never ever manifested before in the history of the world, and the second is there are no cycles, they are illusions created by cherry-picked data; furthermore, markets are now completely controlled by central banks so cycles have vanished.
While it’s easy to see why these delusions are attractive, let’s take a look at a widely used measure of the U.S. housing market, the Case-Shiller Index:
If we look at this chart with fresh eyes, a few things pop out:
1. The U.S. housing market had a this time it’s different experience in the 2000s, as an unprecedented housing bubble inflated, pushing housing far above the trendline of the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index.
2. It turned out this time wasn’t different as this extreme of over-valuation collapsed.
3. For a variety of reasons (massive central bank and state intervention, the socialization of the mortgage market via federally guaranteed mortgages, historically low mortgage rates, massive purchases of mortgage backed securities by the Federal Reserve, etc.), the collapse in prices did not return to the trendline.
4. There is a remarkable time symmetry in each phase of expansion and collapse; each phase took roughly the same period of time to travel from trough to peak and peak to trough.
5. The Index has now exceeded the previous bubble peak, suggesting this time it’s different once again dominates the zeitgeist.
6. Those denying the existence of cycles have difficulty adequately explain away the classic cyclical nature of the 2000-2008 bubble rise and its collapse, and the subsequent expansion of housing prices in a near-perfect mirror-image of the first housing bubble’s steep ascent.
Claiming that this painfully obvious time symmetry is mere randomness/coincidence is not an explanation.
7. This time symmetry suggests that the current housing bubble is close to its zenith and will likely collapse over a time frame similar to Housing Bubble #1.
The basic arguments for ever-higher housing prices forever and ever are:
A. central banks completely control all markets, including housing, and they will never let the housing market decline ever again.
B. Foreign buyers paying cash (even if the “cash” was borrowed in Asia) will continue flooding into North America, elevating markets for the the foreseeable future.
The omnipotence of central banks is a matter of near-religious certainty among the faithful, but skeptics note that central banks have played major roles in markets for decades, yet every asset bubble eventually pops despite central bank/state management of markets.
True believers note that the central state/bank interventions have greatly expanded, and that there are no limits on future interventions; central banks can create trillions of dollars, yuan, yen, euros, etc., and use this “free money” to buy assets, propping up markets indefinitely.
In this line of thinking, central banks/states “learned their lesson” in the first housing bubble and will never let the housing market collapse again.
As for foreign demand: the number of buyers from China who are desperate to turn their cash into North American real estate holdings is practically limitless.
The counter-arguments are:
1. Despite the federal guarantees on mortgages, the housing market is still dominated by private-sector borrowers and lenders. As my colleague Mish has often pointed out, central banks/agencies cannot force people to borrow money to buy homes, vehicles, etc.
If everyone who is qualified to buy a house and wants to buy a house has bought a house, then demand is limited to new households and foreign buyers.
New household formation has recovered a bit but is still at historically low levels. New households burdened by student loan debt, high rents and stagnant wages are not qualified to borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy homes at current nose-bleed valuations.
While the number of foreign buyers may appear to be limitless in specific markets, counting on marginal buyers with cash to prop up markets across the board is an iffy proposition, given the potential for conditions to reverse due to global recession, capital controls, higher taxes imposed on foreign owners of vacant homes, etc.
I would argue that this time is different, but not in a healthy way. Central bank/state interventions in the market have drawn in marginal borrowers who are a few paychecks away from default, and speculators who are leveraged to the hilt to buy homes to “flip for quick profits–a strategy that collapses if qualified buyers become scarce.
Globally, housing has become a flight-to-safety asset for the global elites, a development with disastrous consequences for residents. Housing owned for investment often sits empty, effectively withdrawing much-needed housing units from the market for shelter. This investment buying reduces the pool of available housing, driving up rents and home prices, pushing shelter out of reach of the bottom 95% of wage earners in desirable urban areas.
In response, municipalities are aggressively imposing fees on investment ownership of empty dwellings. At some point, these fees reduce demand for housing in “hot” markets. Once marginal cash purchases evaporate, markets fall back to what domestic demand can support.
Housing markets are one itsy-bitsy recession away from a collapse in domestic and foreign demand by marginal buyers. This time is different isn’t always bullish.

",Spanish regulator clears the way for Atlantia's bid for Abertis,"FILE PHOTO: The Abertis's logo is seen during a news conference in Barcelona, Spain, April 12, 2016. REUTERS/Albert Gea/File Photo
MADRID/MILAN (Reuters) - Spain’s market watchdog approved Italian infrastructure group Atlantia’s (ATL.MI) proposed takeover of Spanish rival Abertis (ABE.MC) on Monday, clearing one of the hurdles to the creation of the world’s biggest toll-roads operator.
Approval comes nearly five months after Atlantia announced it was offering 16.3 billion euros ($19 billion) in cash and shares to buy Abertis.
Spanish regulator CNMV said in a market filing the offer was conditional on shareholders representing at least 10.1 percent of Abertis share capital accepting payment in Atlantia shares.
In addition the offer must be accepted by shareholders representing at least 50 percent plus one share of the Spanish company.
Atlantia is offering to pay 16.5 euros for each Abertis share, a level that CNMV said was equitable.
Abertis shareholders will have 15 calendar days to accept the bid starting from the first trading day following the formal publication of the offer’s prospectus, the watchdog said.
One source with knowledge of the matter said this was expected to happen in the next few days.
Though the offer was described as “friendly” by Atlantia, Abertis’s shareholders have not expressed a view on the bid and potential counter-bids could still emerge.
The board of the Spanish company must publish its assessment of the bid within 10 days after the start of the acceptance period, Atlantia said.
The top shareholder in Abertis is Criteria Caixa, the financial arm of a politically connected and powerful banking foundation that controls Catalonia’s largest lender Caixabank (CABK.MC).
Several potential rivals for acquiring Abertis have been named in media reports in recent months, but only Spanish builder ACS (ACS.MC), which is headed by Real Madrid soccer club Chairman Florentino Perez, has said it is looking at making a possible counter-offer.
ACS is expected to decide this month whether to make an offer.
In the prospectus published on the website of Spain’s CNMV, the Italian group said it was leaving the door open to changing the bid to an all-cash offer.
Atlantia, controlled by Italy’s Benetton family, also said in the document it would sell a portion of Abertis’s 34 percent shareholding in telecom masts company Cellnex (CLNX.MC) to avoid having to make a full bid for Cellnex.
It also repeated it was ready to sell Abertis’s satellites business Hispasat if requested by the Spanish government.

HODEIDAH, Yemen (Reuters) - One of the latest victims of the cholera epidemic that has killed more than 2,000 people in Yemen had yet to even take her first breath.
Her mother Safaa Issa Kaheel, then nine months pregnant, was brought into a crowded clinic in the Western port city of Hodeidah by her husband, who had to borrow the travel fare from a neighbor. “My stomach started hurting more and more,” said Kaheel, 37, a hydrating drip hooked into her arm.
Once there, she was referred by nurse Hayam al-Shamaa for an ultrasound scan which showed her baby had died of dehydration - one of 15 to perish in the womb due to cholera in September and October, according to doctors at the city’s Thawra hospital.
“I felt like death,” Kaheel said, her voice strained. “Thank god I survived the (delivery), but my diarrhea hasn’t stopped.”
The Red Cross has warned that cholera, a diarrheal disease that has been eradicated in most developed countries, could infect a million people in Yemen by the end of the year.
Two and a half years of war have sapped Yemen of the money and medical facilities it needs to battle the contagion, to which aid agencies and medics say the poor, the starving, the pregnant and the young are most vulnerable.
The cholera ward is full of children - some writhing in agony, others eerily still. The blanket over one boy too weak to move rises and falls with his shallow breathing.

Save the Children said in August that children under 15 represent nearly half of new cases and a third of deaths, with malnourished children more than six times more likely to die of cholera than well-fed ones.
Millions of Yemenis are struggling to find food and the baking desert plains around Hodeidah are hotspots both of hunger and sickness.

Yemen’s war pits the armed Houthi movement against the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition that has launched thousands of air strikes to restore him to power.
At least 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict.
The country’s health sector has been badly battered while a struggle over the central bank has left public sector salaries for doctors and sanitation workers unpaid.
Soumaya Beltifa, spokesperson for the Red Cross in Sanaa, warned that a lack of funds and health personnel were blunting efforts to eradicate the disease, making it unlikely Yemen would be healthy again soon.
“The cholera epidemic has become a norm, leading to complacency in dealing with the disease, not only by civilians but also from the various (aid) organizations,” she warned.",1

Los Angeles, CA, Sep 30, 2017 - Southern California based rockers Dynamos are set to release their debut single “Shake, Rattle and Roll” on October 13, 2017 to all online retail outlets worldwide. The break-out song will also be accompanied by a live performance music video.
“Shake, Rattle and Roll” marks an igniting introduction for Dynamos and asserts that the emerging band is a mighty force to be reckoned with. The song opens with crunching guitars and a spellbinding bassline that leads right into powerhouse vocalist Nadia E.’s growling first verse. With her sultry charm, Nadia unfolds a vivid story of a lover expressing her rich infatuation with her partner. The lust is so intoxicating it impels her to literally ‘Shake, Rattle and Roll.’ The song travels into searing guitar solos and trembling drum licks that elevate the single’s infectious pulse.
The accompanying music video was filmed during a live performance of the Dynamos in Los Angeles, CA. The video exhibits the band’s raw delivery and tremendous chemistry. Dynamos’ innate sense of enthusiasm and musicianship shines through this live performance and invites listeners to attend one of their live shows.
Introducing a contemporary blend of traditional and modern rock music, Dynamos burst into the scene earlier this year with their debut EP, Cold Comfort. With their vibrant, striking instrumentals and passionate call and response, this American rock band intends to share their knowledge and love of music to the masses. Dynamos is led by front woman and lead vocalist, Nadia E. She is accompanied by Nick Schaadt (music director, bass), Jacob Mayeda (lead guitar), Ian Nakazawa (drums), and Carlos Barrera (lead guitar). Nadia E. is known to rock the house with her soul-shaking voice and visual storytelling. Together, Dynamos combine technical expertise with pure raw energy to deliver a unique and captivating listening experience.

",Trump NFL row: Mike Pence walks out of game after players kneel,"Image copyright @VP/Twitter Image caption Mike Pence said he abandoned the game because kneeling during the anthem ""disrespects our soldiers""
US Vice-President Mike Pence has walked out of a National Football League (NFL) game after several players refused to stand for the US national anthem.
Mr Pence said he could not be present at an event that ""disrespects our soldiers, our flag"" after abandoning the game in his home state of Indiana.
President Donald Trump tweeted that he had asked Mr Pence to leave if players kneeled and said he was ""proud of him"".
Kneeling at NFL games has become a form of protest against racial injustice.
Mr Trump has criticised players sharply for the protests and pressed the NFL to ban them.
""I left today's Colts game because @POTUS [President Trump] and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our flag, or our National Anthem,"" Mr Pence tweeted on Sunday.
A long journey to make a point
By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington
Mike Pence travelled quite a ways - from Nevada to Indianapolis then back west to California - to make a statement.
There's little doubt the vice-president, despite his earlier tweet about looking forward to attending an NFL game in his home state, planned to walk out early.
The matchup involved the San Francisco 49ers, whose then-quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, started the kneeling protests. Mr Pence's media pool was told the vice-president might be making a quick exit. And Mr Pence's press statement, followed by a presidential tweet of approval, appeared shortly after Mr Pence left.
Next come the questions. Was that statement worth the vice-president's time? And how much did that trip cost US taxpayers?
Trump's supporters are already celebrating the move, helping the vice-president burnish his standing with his boss's loyal base.
Some of the NFL players were clearly irritated by what they saw as a political publicity stunt.
Americans, according to polls, are split. They're not happy about the NFL protests, but they don't like Mr Trump's eagerness to stoke the flames of controversy. Now - as tensions rise in North Korea and yet another hurricane slams into the US - Mr Pence is joining the anthem fray.
Mr Pence's departure came after players from the visiting San Francisco 49ers did not stand during the anthem before the game against the Indianapolis Colts.
""While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don't think it's too much to ask NFL players to respect the flag,"" Mr Pence added.
Skip Twitter post by @VP I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem. — Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017 Report
He had earlier tweeted that he and his wife Karen were looking forward to the game in a tweet in which he used of photo of then both wearing Colts shirts.
That the photo appeared also to have been used in 2014 has in part helped fuel critics' claims his walk out was a publicity stunt.
His team won the game 26-23.
Mr Trump has previously said that his comments condemning the NFL protests have ""nothing to do with race"".
But his criticism of the protests has appeared to galvanise players,

Recent protests have involved players kneeling, linking arms or staying in the locker room during the Star-Spangled Banner.
San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick stirred controversy last year when he first knelt for the anthem to highlight the treatment of black Americans after a series of police shootings.
Since then, more and more public figures in the US have been ""taking a knee"" at big events and using the hashtag #TakeAKnee on social media.",1

Puerto Rico got destroyed by Hurricane Maria. But Mayor Carmen Cruz is accused of BLOCKING supplies from dying locals — while she blames Trump.
 
Why isn’t she handing out supplies — and why is Mayor Carmen Cruz wearing a custom T-Shirt?
 
Meanwhile, a “cop” in Puerto Rico telephones an NYC radio station crying about Communism and begging the US Military to take over Puerto Rico.
 
Is this a real humanitarian crisis, made worse by corrupt Puerto Rico politicians? Or is this a ruse to make Puerto Rico the 51st State?
 
After all, if Puerto Ricans are getting abused/starved by their own leaders, doesn’t the US Government need to take over “for the good of humanity?” 
 
Every few years, the Regime tries to make Puerto Rico the 51st State. This would mean millions of new Democrat voters in mainland US elections.
 
But how to justify making Puerto Rico a State? Invading Iraq was “morally justified” by stories of abusive leaders committing “crimes against humanity.” Could taking over Puerto Rico be “morally justified” by tales of diabolical leaders purposely starving their own people? Is that the impression Mayor Cruz is trying to give on CNN?
 
Is that the goal of this “no supplies” scam? American Statehood for Puerto Rico, as State number 51?

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/us/politics/federal-debt-deficits.html,"Fear of Federal Debt Has Faded, but Risks Remain","The amount owed to investors is $14.4 trillion. That’s already a record, but economists prefer to measure the debt in relation to the economy. The United States can afford a larger debt as the economy grows, just as millionaires can afford larger mortgages.
As the federal debt rose in the 1980s, and again in the early 2000s, so did the chorus of dire warnings: Inflation and interest rates would rise, economic growth would falter — and, at some point, the markets might simply refuse to finance the federal government over concerns it would be unable to pay its bills.
This time around, even those who regard the debt as a real and present danger have become more cautious about the presentation of those arguments. They say policy makers simply can’t know when markets might begin to demand higher rates.
“We don’t have a measure of how much fiscal space we have, but a good political metric is to see how far we are from a record-high level of debt,” said Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group whose name describes its views.
He noted that the debt was on a pace to exceed the high point reached after World War II. “I don’t want to be in the business of testing how far we can go,” he said.
The problem confronting those who want the government to reduce annual deficits is that the short-term consequences of profligacy have proved to be very modest, while the political benefits are substantial.
“It doesn’t take a political scientist to understand that taking stuff away is a lot less popular than giving stuff out,” Mr. Goldwein said.

Low interest rates have greatly reduced the government’s borrowing costs. Measured as a share of the national economy, the federal debt is about three times as large as in the 1960s, but by the same measure, the interest payments are about the same.
Interest payments are still projected to total $6 trillion over the next decade. And one thing that has changed: 40 percent of the debt is now held by foreign investors.
The impact of federal borrowing on the rest of the economy is harder to assess.
Economists warned for decades that deficits caused inflation and reduced the amount of money available to the private sector, ultimately reducing growth and prosperity.
The years under President Ronald Reagan suggested that those theories needed some work. As federal deficits ballooned, inflation declined — and all the while the economy grew.

“Reagan proved that deficits don’t matter,” Vice President Dick Cheney said in 2002, as the George W. Bush administration pursued a similar fiscal policy with roughly the same results.
The International Monetary Fund in 2003 published a study of 107 countries over four decades that found little connection between deficits and inflation in developed nations.
The economist Robert Mundell had predicted all of this in the early 1970s, offering an alternative to the standard theory that came to be known as supply-side economics.
He argued that the government should cut taxes to stimulate the economy, then raise interest rates to attract foreign investment, offsetting the increased federal borrowing.
“Suppose it does mean a budget deficit in the United States,” he declared at the 1971 conference where he first presented the proposal. “Who cares?”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
When he was asked in the 1970s, Mr. Mundell predicted the money would come from the Saudis. In the 1980s, it came from the Japanese. In the 2000s, it came from the Chinese. The one constant has been a sufficient supply of money.
Other economists still see evidence that government borrowing weighs on the economy by reducing the money available for investment. This “crowding out” reduces the progress of productivity, which in turn suppresses the growth of incomes — a fairly straight line from more federal debt to less money in the average American wallet.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2014 that each dollar of debt reduces private-sector investment by somewhere between 15 and 50 cents, after accounting for the role of higher rates in encouraging domestic and foreign investment.
As the fear of debt has faded, both parties in recent years have embraced proposals to stimulate the economy at the cost of larger short-term deficits. Democrats have backed increased investment in infrastructure, education and research. Republicans argue that the government should simply leave more money in private hands.
Douglas Elmendorf, who led the Congressional Budget Office from 2009 to 2015, repeatedly predicted then that increased federal borrowing would pinch the economy. He said the failure of those predictions suggested there was room to borrow.
“The economy has recovered and interest rates have not risen, and that has caused a great deal of reflection and analysis,” said Mr. Elmendorf, who is now the dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. “The widespread conclusion is that interest rates are likely to stay below historical norms for an extended period.”
Mr. Elmendorf said the government in the long term still faced a difficult choice of some combination of raising taxes and reducing entitlements. It would be easiest to start soon so those changes can be made gradually. He noted that changes to the Social Security program passed in 1983 are still taking effect 34 years later.
In the short term, he said, the government should focus less on increasing overall economic growth than on improving the prospects of lower-income households.
Daniel Shaviro, a law professor at New York University, wrote a book called “Do Deficits Matter?” in the mid-1990s, back when most people thought the answer was yes. Today, he said, he worries that people are becoming too confident the answer is no.

He said the larger risks were real. If the debt continues to rise, “there’s a pretty good chance that something bad is going to happen at some point,” Mr. Shaviro said. “And you’d rather turn the wheel slowly and gradually rather than stopping abruptly.”",1

",The U.S. Government Is Suing People For Requesting Public Records,"By Aaron Kesel
The U.S. government is suing citizens requesting public records all over the country, violating the Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA). The government is stating that it is in “good faith” to take away more of our rights, intimidate us and delay FOIA requests, thus challenging the notion of transparency and, in turn, the Open Government Initiative.
Throughout the U.S. government, a growing number of organizations, school districts, municipalities, and state agencies have filed lawsuits against citizens for making FOIA requests to obtain public information. The governmental bodies argue that they are doing so to let the court decide a matter that isn’t quite clear legally such as when the documents may be shielded by an exemption or privacy laws. But that’s causing problems, and becoming a new way for governments to hide information from taxpayers and even news organizations or individual journalists.
The practice, although highly ridiculed and uncommon, has been going on for years according to Columbia Journalism Review.
However, recently the Associated Press reported three different cases where the government sued citizens in the last year.
In the first case, an Oregon parent Kim Sordyl and journalist Beth Slovic sought details about Portland Public School employees on paid leave. The school board responded by suing them both, arguing that the records are exempt from disclosure due to the personal privacy of employees.
The second case involved two retired teachers, Dr. James Finney and Mike Deshotels, who were sued by Louisiana Department of Education for trying to get information on the school’s enrollment data relating to economically disadvantaged and English proficiency students. The two eventually ended up winning the case in a settlement but not before fighting for their rights in court to even see the data and spending $3,000 in legal fees.
Finally, the third case highlighting this abusive practice that the publication mentioned was Western Kentucky University suing two newspapers. The University filed a lawsuit against its paper, the College Heights Herald and the University of Kentucky campus newspaper, Kentucky Kernel, which sought records related to allegations of sexual harassment and assault involving its faculty. That story titled: “In The Dark: Records shed light on sexual misconduct at Kentucky universities” went on to win the University of Georgia’s Betty Gage Holland Award for excellence in college journalism and using a FOIA request to bring the questionable abuse to light.
“It’s appropriate to say it’s troubling the university (WKU) is suing its own newspaper for practicing good journalism,” attorney Michael Abate told the WKU paper, the College Heights Herald. “Even if they have a valid basis for withholding information, they still have to submit redacted documents.”
In 2015 a New Jersey Judge Michael Winkelstein ruled in favor of Harry Scheeler Jr. who was seeking Hamilton Township police surveillance video and was subsequently sued for his request, Columbia Journalism Review reported. In New Jersey, the state has a law called the Open Public Records Act (OPRA) in place of a Freedom of Information request. The judge ruled that such practices of governments counter-suing citizens was the antithesis of OPRA.
Winkelstein found that,
A government lawsuit against requestors subjects them to involuntary litigation with all of its concomitant financial, temporal, and emotional trimmings. A public policy that gives a government agency the right to sue a person who asks for a government document is the antithesis of the OPRA and common-law policy of providing citizens with a means of access to public information to keep government activities open and hold the government accountable.
Earlier this year in Michigan, the state House voted overwhelmingly 108-0 in favor of a bill that would make it illegal for government agencies to sue citizens who request public records.
The legislation was in response to a local county’s lawsuit against a newspaper that was seeking documents on two employees running for sheriff. A judge dismissed the lawsuit, saying the county had to approve or deny the request.
The bill’s sponsor, Republican Rep. Klint Kesto, called the lawsuit “a backdoor channel to delay and put pressure on the requester” that circumvents the state’s Freedom of Information Act.
“Government shouldn’t file a lawsuit and go on offense. Either approve the request or deny it,” he said. “This shouldn’t be happening anywhere in the country.”
It’s troubling that so many of these requests have resulted in lawsuits against citizens who have a right to know public information under the Freedom of Information Act.

",‘Revenge Was Sweet’: Trinidad and Tobago Exults in Soccer Victory Over U.S.,"And then there were the memes, mostly mocking President Trump. In one, he throws paper towels over the waterlogged field to his team on the other side. Another takes the form of a fake tweet from the president’s account: “But why do we have to play against 2 teams, Trinidad AND Tobago??? Not fair.”
Darryl Smith, the country’s sports minister, said he spent much of the night celebrating the victory at Ato Boldon Stadium in Couva, in the central part of Trinidad. Ultimately, it seemed, what was important wasn’t whether the island advanced, but rather the drama that unfolded.
“This was good for football since it was nail-biting till the end,” he said. “We haven’t won for a while. The U.S.A. has been a rival since 1989 when we were stuffed out by them.”
Mr. Smith was alluding to a painful date in the history of sports on the islands — Nov. 19, 1989 — when the Trinidad and Tobago Strike Squad, its soccer team, needed only a draw with the United States to qualify for the World Cup.

Instead, all hopes were dashed before a crowd of 25,000 at the country’s national stadium, who watched the Americans prevail 1-0. Trinidad and Tobago has qualified for the World Cup only once since.
“I was 6 years old when we lost to the U.S.,” said Michelline Dasrathsingh, 34, who took her young son to watch the match against the Americans on Tuesday evening.
The crowd was small, perhaps expecting another defeat. Few could believe it when Trinidad began scoring against the United States — once, then a second time — and the Americans were never able to catch up.
“There was singing and dancing at the final whistle,” Ms. Dasrathsingh said.
The D.J. at the stadium blasted the song “Fighter,” a calypso tune dedicated to the Soca Warriors, the last team from the islands to make it to the World Cup, in Germany in 2006.

Everol Bruce, 58, a retired police officer, was still replaying the game in his head on Wednesday. The ground was good for a game that night, if a bit damp, he said. The Trinidad and Tobago goalkeeper performed marvelously.

Alvin Corneal, a local commentator and former coaching instructor, said the victory stemmed from the psychology of the Trinidad and Tobago team’s having nothing to lose. He also said the team, unnoticed by United States, had improved and shifted players in preparation for the game with the Americans.
Mr. Corneal says the team still has a lot of work to do, but the win would lift morale.
As for the Americans, he said: “They got the shock of their lives. I am happy that the U.S.A. should realize that there are other people in the world who exist.”",1

How in the world can liberal Democrats be considered decent people? Big-time movie mogul Harvey Weinstein has been exposed as having for years been a known woman abuser, but will now be forgiven for his past bad behavior as long as he attacks and tries to destroy the National Rifle Association. Does this make any sense to reasonable people? I have no doubt that it makes sense to liberals, but I mean to regular, reasonable people. “Even with all the challenges that lie ahead for Weinstein, I am still not ready to write him off,” Forbes columnist Jonathan Berr wrote Thursday. “If Mel Gibson can be forgiven for his sins, there is hope for Weinstein.” Poor Donald Trump was savaged and declared unfit to be president for having just spoken crudely in a private conversation with other men about women, but a man who actually abused women is forgiven and adored because he’s a liberal and he will spend money and time attacking the NRA, an organization that has never attacked or abused a woman. And how about the quick and decisive removals of conservatives Bill O’Reilly and Eric Bolling when rather timid rumors were spread about them? Could there …

",Catalonia baulks at formal independence declaration to allow talks,"Catalan President Carles Puigdemont signs a declaration of independence at the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona, Spain, October 10, 2017. REUTERS/Albert Gea
BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia’s leader balked at making a formal declaration of independence from Spain on Tuesday, calling for talks with Madrid over the region’s future in a gesture that eased fears of immediate unrest in the heart of the euro zone.
In a much-anticipated speech to the Catalan parliament, ringed by thousands of protesters and hundreds of armed police, Carles Puigdemont made only a symbolic declaration, claiming a mandate to launch secession but suspending any formal steps to that end.
His remarks disappointed many of his supporters who had gathered outside, waving Catalan flags in the expectation that he would move a formal independence motion to the assembly.
But the speech pleased financial markets, boosting the euro on hopes that his gesture would mark a de-escalation of Spain’s worst political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981.
Tensions have been climbing in Catalonia since it went ahead on Oct. 1 with an independence referendum that Madrid had deemed unconstitutional. Despite a violent police crackdown, Catalan officials say the result was an overwhelming “yes” vote.
But instead of moving a motion in regional parliament on Tuesday, as Spanish unionists had feared, Puigdemont and other regional politicians signed a proclamation of “full sovereignty” for Catalonia. Its legal value was unclear.
“I am disappointed. I hoped for a declaration of independence and it didn’t happen,” said 18-year-old student Julia Lluch, among a crowd of independence supporters who were rolling up their flags and drifting away from the assembly.
In Brussels, though, there was a sense of relief that the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy now had at least bought some time to deal with a crisis that was still far from over.
One EU official said Puigdemont “seems to have listened to advice not to do something irreversible”.
However, the prospects for political talks still appeared remote on Tuesday despite Puigdemont’s gesture, with Madrid insisting on talks to be held “within the law”, a phrase that is widely interpreted as ruling out independence as an option.
Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria also rejected the Catalan leader’s proposal for talks to be conducted by an international mediator. “Neither Mr. Puigdemont nor anybody else can claim ... to impose mediation,” she said.
The Spanish government will meet on Wednesday to decide on its response to Puigdemont’s declaration.
STOCKS, EURO RISE
Both Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s government and European Council President Donald Tusk had urged Puigdemont not to proclaim independence. And French President Emmanuel Macron rejected Puigdemont’s call for European Union mediation, saying he was confident Madrid could handle the situation.

The Catalan government said 90 percent of those who voted backed independence but turnout was only 43 percent as many opponents of independence stayed at home.
Puigdemont told the Barcelona regional parliament that the result provided a popular mandate for independence and he called for talks and reduced tensions.
”We aren’t criminals, nor crazy, nor coup plotters, nor abducted,“ he said. ”We are normal people who ask to be allowed to vote and who have been ready for all the dialogue necessary to achieve it in an agreed way.
“I assume ... the mandate that Catalonia become an independent state in the form of a republic,” he said to prolonged applause.
“I propose suspending the effects of the declaration of independence to undertake talks in the coming weeks without which it is not possible to reach an agreed solution.”

After Puigdemont’s speech, stocks around the world rose as Wall Street eked out record highs ahead of earnings season, while U.S. Treasury prices pared gains.
Some analysts, however, said Puigdemont’s stance would prolong the uncertainty and risk from the Catalan impasse.
It could also rock his Catalan government, with one far-left party inside his coalition, the pro-independence CUP, saying he may have missed an historic opportunity and giving him one month to find a negotiated solution the CUP doubts will ever come.
“You say we are suspending the effects because we are going to negotiation and mediation. Negotiation and mediation with whom? With a Spanish state that continues to harass and persecute us?” CUP leader Anna Gabriel said.
The Catalan crisis has deeply divided the northeastern region as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of around 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.
The stakes are high - losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.
Some of Catalonia’s largest companies have moved their head offices out of the region this week and others were set to follow if he had declared independence.
Independence supporters watched Puigdemont’s speech on large screens outside the 18th-century parliament building. Initially, people chanted “independence”, cheered and kissed each other, but as it became clear there would be no formal declaration of independence, some people whistled and shook their heads.
Pensioner Marisol Rioja, 65, said: “We would have liked more. But he (Puigdemont) couldn’t do it.”
Eric Martinez, a 27-year-old manager, also wept as he watched the speech with his girlfriend. “There is no solution through mediation with Spain. Mediation with Spain is useless,” he said.",1

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
According to Darren Urban (via Twitter):
“Arians, on @AZSports, said Chris Johnson will remain the starting”
Of course Johnson disappointed in a starting role on Monday night:
Chris Johnson – 13 touches for 21 yards
Andre Ellington – 10 touches for 81 yards
The Cardinals were trailing in the fourth quarter, and that may have led to more opportunities for Ellington. You also had Johnson continuing to get up to speed, and another week of practice/action will only help improve his performance.
Than we have the Week 4 opponent, as it is highly unlikely that the San Francisco 49ers get out to a big lead. They are also allowing the sixth most points per week to opposing running backs, including the seventh most rushing yards (323). They’ve faced the fourth most rushing attempts (85), so you want to keep it in perspective, but that also speaks to the team falling behind and opponents managing the clock.
Johnson isn’t going to be a stellar option, but he’s going to dominate early down carries and has a positive matchup. With the Cardinals potentially getting out to a big lead and wanting to get Johnson going, it all comes together for a potentially solid day.
Consider him more of a low-end RB2, at best, and a FLEX option in all formats. In other words, depending on your alternatives he’s a worthy play in all formats (though not quite as attractive in PPR).

""It's the calm before the storm right here
Wait, how was I gonna start this off?
I forgot... oh, yeah
That's an awfully hot coffee pot
Should I drop it on Donald Trump? Probably not
But that's all I got 'til I come up with a solid plot
Got a plan and now I gotta hatch it
Like a damn Apache with a tomahawk
Imma walk inside a mosque on Ramadan
And say a prayer that every time Melania talks
She gets a mou... Ahh, Imma stop
But we better give Obama props
'Cause what we got in office now's a kamikaze
That'll probably cause a nuclear holocaust
And while the drama pops
And he waits for s**t to quiet down, he'll just gas his plane up and fly around 'til the bombing stops
Intensities heightened, tensions are risin'
Trump, when it comes to giving a s**t, you're stingy as I am
Except when it comes to having the b***s to go against me, you hide 'em
'Cause you don't got the f**king n**s like an empty asylum
Racism's the only thing he's fantastic for
'Cause that's how he gets his f**king rocks off and he's orange
Yeah, sick tan
That's why he wants us to disband
'Cause he cannot withstand
The fact we're not afraid of Trump
F**k walkin' on egg shells, I came to stomp
That's why he keeps screamin' 'Drain the swamp'
'Cause he's in quicksand
It's like we take a step forwards, then backwards
But this is his form of distraction
Plus, he gets an enormous reaction
When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that
Instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada
All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather
Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers
Then says he wants to lower our taxes
Then who's gonna pay for his extravagant trips
Back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?
Same s**t that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered
Then does it more
From his endorsement of Bannon
Support for the Klansmen
Tiki torches in hand for the soldier that's black
And comes home from Iraq
And is still told to go back to Africa
Fork and a dagger in this racist 94-year-old grandpa
Who keeps ignoring our past historical, deplorable factors
Now if you're a black athlete, you're a spoiled little brat for
Tryina use your platform or your stature
To try to give those a voice who don't have one
He says, 'You're spittin' in the face of vets who fought for us, you bastards!'
Unless you're a POW who's tortured and battered
'Cause to him you're zeros
'Cause he don't like his war heroes captured
That's not disrespecting the military
F**k that! This is for Colin, ball up a fist!
And keep that s**t balled like Donald the b**ch!
'He's gonna get rid of all immigrants!'
'He's gonna build that thang up taller than this!'
Well, if he does build it, I hope it's rock solid with bricks
'Cause like him in politics, I'm using all of his tricks
'Cause I'm throwin' that piece of s**t against the wall 'til it sticks
And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his
I'm drawing in the sand a line: you're either for or against
And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split
On who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this:

",11 & US Govt Has Proven They ‘Hate Our Freedom’ Just As Much as Terrorists,"By Matt Agorist
“They hate our freedoms: our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other.” – George W. Bush addresses the nation on September 20, 2001 — 9 Days after the attacks
Those of us who are old enough to remember a time before 9/11 can recall “the good old days” before the police state was ramped up to the militaristic control grid that it is today.
We remember a time before fear became the only thing that your television fed you. Sure, the propaganda machine and the war machine has existed long before 9/11, but since that fateful day, the fear peddlers and the tyrants have cranked it up a notch – or ten.
Freedom diminishing step one: The TSA
Prior to 9/11, no one heard of the Transportation Security Administration because they didn’t exist. The TSA was created as a reactionary security measure to hijackers sneaking box-cutters onto planes. It has since morphed into a vile organization of total domination, degradation, theft, and molestation.
If you think taking your shoes off at the airport makes you safer, you need to read more history.
Freedom diminishing step two: The NSA
Having worked directly under the NSA for several years prior to the attacks on 9/11, I can tell you that spying on Americans was not only frowned upon by our superiors, but it was a chargeable offense. During my years as an Intelligence Communications Intercept Operator, we were told that if we came across “friendly chatter,” we move on, or we go to jail.
However, since 9/11, the NSA has conducted an about face. The restrictions that kept myself and my team from spying on Americans were lifted. The tentacles of this police state leviathan quickly spread their way into every facet of American life. We wouldn’t find out until several years later that all of our private data has been, and forever will be, subject to the prying eyes of the State.
Freedom diminishing step three: Perpetual War
The attacks on the world trade centers ushered in a new means of the state to spread its empire. A new and vaguely defined ‘enemy’ had been declared and its name was terrorism.
“Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists,” George Bush ironically said immediately after saying the terrorists “hate us…because we can disagree with each other.”
Literally overnight, the entire world was declared an enemy of the United States unless they prostrated themselves and declared their unwavering support for the US empire.
This notion gave birth to the state’s ability to declare a perpetual war. The war on the ‘tactic’ of terrorism would give way to an unlimited expansion of police state powers, and the state knew it. Bush would even state this idea in his speech. Later in the same September 20th speech, Bush would declare that the war “will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.” In the same speech, he later said that this war is “a task that does not end.”
Despite both Obama and Bush declaring the wars a success and having ended, nothing could be further from the truth as Trump’s recent plan to re-escalate America’s presence in Afghanistan illustrates. Since 9/11 secret US prisons popped up where unspeakable acts of torture continue to this day. Millions of innocent civilians have been slain and continue to be slain. Countless children have been blown to bits by Americans spreading democracy with Hellfire missiles.
All the while, the average American continues to praise the government for “keeping them free” and unquestioningly continues life as normal.
Freedom diminishing step four: The Militarization of Police
Along with perpetual war comes the perpetual lobbying of defense contractors for bigger and better ways to kill people.
“In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist,” Dwight D. Eisenhower famously said in his 1961 farewell speech. He couldn’t have been more right.
As taxpayer dollars go to buying newer and nicer tools of death, these older tools of death need a new home.
Conveniently enough, the government had a program in place since 1997, which allowed for the old tools of war to come home and be used against the American people. It was called the 1033 program. Even though Obama ended this program in 2015, his champion of the police state successor just turned this program back on, paving the way for the creation of a standing army that our forefathers warned us about.
Within just a few short years, thousands of police departments across the country were issued mine-resistant vehicles, amphibious assault vehicles, grenade launchers, countless high-powered machine guns, and even Apache attack choppers—and now, all that is back.
All of this military gear, we are told, is to keep us safe.
Freedom diminishing step five: The End of Free Speech
As governments throughout history have attempted to spread their empire across the globe, a side effect is the creation of a police state at home. The United States is no exception, and as the police state grows, so does resistance to it.
This resistance becomes a thorn in the side of tyrants and they will do everything in their power to silence it.
Since 9/11, America has entered a Post-Constitutional era of “Free Speech Zones,” riot police with sound cannons blasting down peaceful dissenters, and worse. Now, identity politics are pushed upon the masses through the mainstream media causing violence at protests between the us’s and them’s. Protest violence is playing right into the hands of the police state as it easily allows them to demonize all free-speech.
As the Free Thought Project’s Jay Syrmopoulos points out, if there is one thing that Islamic fundamentalists and Islamophobic fascists agree on, it’s that there should be no “gray zone;” only black and white. The establishment’s identity politics are paving the way for this black and white world.
The gray zone is the zone of peaceful coexistence. Eliminating the gray zone – and rendering a world as black & white as the flag of the Islamic state is the ultimate goal of fundamentalists on all sides.
In fact, a recent ISIS publication, titled Extinction of the Grayzone made clear that the strategy has been at play for the past 14 years.
The grayzone is critically endangered, rather on the brink of extinction. It’s endangerment began with the blessed operation of September 11th, as these operations manifested two camps before the world for mankind to choose between, a camp of Islam… and a camp of kufr – the crusader coalition.
American policy is playing right into the hands of terrorists and the citizens are playing right along.
But all hope is not lost.
Freedom regaining step one: Be the Change
Sadly enough, this counterfeit version of the “Land of the Free” is now the new normal. The next generation’s benchmark for “Freedom” will be journalists being snatched up in the streets, and cops publicly executing citizens and not being charged.
The dystopian future that Americans are now taking part in creating is an ominous reality.
However, to those of us who see the entire picture and remember a time when it wasn’t okay for the blue gloves at the TSA to prod your anus in the name of freedom, we remain resilient.
So, next time your chest begins to fill with patriotic puff, stop for a second and realize that Americans are not free anymore. America is becoming the evil that it once stood against.
In the meantime, however, we still have the freedom in this country to inform ourselves and others. Only through a lesser ignorance will these horrid tyrannical traits subside.
Humanity is involved in a struggle, as we have always been, but there are much more of us now. Inciting peaceful change has never been more important. However, so many well-meaning individuals go about inciting this change with blunt force. As the violence at the recent protests across the country in the last year have shown—this has to change.
If you truly want to make the world a more peaceful place, you have to become a more peaceful person. Petty infighting, personal attacks, vitriol, and hate are the tools of tyrants and also of those who only claim to be awake.
Peace is true professionalism and it is also the means by which effective change is sought.
Be the change that you want to see in this world.

",10 toughest places for girls to go to school,"Image copyright Unicef Image caption South Sudan has been named as the worst place in the world for education for girls
Debates about schools in richer countries are often about the politics of priorities, what subjects should be given most importance, who needs extra help and what needs more public spending.
But for families in many developing countries questions about education can be a lot more basic - is there any access to school at all?
Figures from the United Nations suggest there has been ""almost zero progress"" in the past decade in tackling the lack of school places in some of the world's poorest countries.
A further report examined the quality of education, and the UN said the findings were ""staggering"", with more than 600 million children in school but learning next to nothing.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In Niger, four out of five adult women remain illiterate
While in affluent Western countries, girls are often ahead of boys in academic achievement, in poorer parts of the world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, girls are much more likely to be missing out.
And on the UN's International Day of the Girl, the development campaign, One, has created a ranking for the toughest places for girls to get an education.
Conflict zones
Across these 10 countries, most of those without school places are girls.
These are fragile countries, where many families are at risk from poverty, ill health, poor nutrition and displacement from war and conflict.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Refugees displaced by fighting this summer in South Sudan
Many young girls are expected to work rather than go to school. And many marry young, ending any chance of an education.
UN figures indicate girls are more than twice as likely to lose out on education in conflict zones.
Image copyright Unicef Image caption Refugees in Chad: Conflicts have disrupted the educations of tens of millions
The rankings are based on:
the proportion of girls without a primary school place
the proportion of girls without a secondary school place
the proportion of girls completing primary school
the proportion of girls completing secondary school
the average number of years girls attend school
female illiteracy rates
teacher training levels
the teacher-pupil ratio
public spending on education
For some countries, such as Syria, there was insufficient reliable data for them to be included.
Here are the top 10 toughest places for girls' education:
South Sudan: the world's newest country has faced much violence and war, with the destruction of schools and families forced from their homes. Almost three-quarters of girls do not even make it to primary school Central African Republic: one teacher for every 80 pupils Niger: only 17% of women between the ages of 15 and 24 are literate Afghanistan: wide gender gap, with boys more likely to be in school than girls Chad: many social and economic barriers to girls and women getting education Mali: only 38% of girls finish primary school Guinea: the average time in education among women over the age of 25 is less than one year Burkina Faso: only 1% of girls complete secondary school Liberia: almost two-thirds of primary-age pupils out of school Ethiopia: two in five girls are married before the age of 18
A shortage of teachers is a common problem across poorer countries.
Last year, the UN said another 69 million teachers would need to be recruited worldwide by 2030 if international promises on education were to be kept.
Image caption Florence Cheptoo learned to read at 60, when her grandchild brought home a library book
The report says there are great economic dividends if girls can be kept in school.
And there are great gains for individuals, such as Florence Cheptoo, who lives in a remote village in Kenya and learned to read at the age of 60.
Gayle Smith, president of the One campaign, called the failures in education for girls a ""global crisis that perpetuates poverty"".
""Over 130 million girls are still out of school - that's over 130 million potential engineers, entrepreneurs, teachers and politicians whose leadership the world is missing out on.""

","Food Truck Giving Free Food to Hurricane Workers, Kicked Out of Town for Not Having a Permit","By Matt Agorist
Green Cove Springs, FL — After Irma devastated Florida, most restaurants and stores were shut down in certain areas. Green Cove Springs was one of those places. So, when Jack Roundtree, owner of the Triple J BBQ food truck, arrived in town, not only was he welcomed with open arms — he was desperately needed. As he sold BBQ to paying customers, Roundtree used the extra money to feed utility workers for free for all their hard work. However, once officials saw a man who’d dare sell food in their town without paying them first, police were called in to make quick work of this entrepreneurial good Samaritan.
Shut down and get out of town—is what Roundtree was told by local authorities for both providing charity and a much-needed product and service. Why was Roundtree told to get out of town, you ask? Well, he hadn’t paid the local government for the ‘privilege’ to sell food to those in need inside Green Cove Springs.
Roundtree is no outlaw. In fact, Green Cove Springs actually encouraged him to sell his BBQ during their monthly Saturday-in-the-Park event before the hurricane. But not this time.
Even if he would’ve gone to city hall to buy a permit to sell during the Irma aftermath, however, he couldn’t—they were closed.
According to Clay Today:
It was interesting to learn that Roundtree and his truck were encouraged to serve customers during Green Cove’s monthly Saturday-in-the-Park event without a permit, but during Irma’s aftermath, not so much. Had Roundtree decided to press his case at City Hall, he would have been greeted with a sign that read: ‘Due to Hurricane Irma, City Hall offices and services will re-open on Thursday, Sept. 14, 2017.’
So, instead of allowing Roundtree to offer free food to utility workers and sell food to people during their time of need, and just get a permit after government employees decided to return to work—they just kicked him out of town.
Here’s how one Green Cove Spring witness, Bettie Tune, described the events at Rich’s on her Facebook page, as reported by Clay Today:
The irony here is that he was kicked out of town for failing to get a permit by government workers because the other government workers who would’ve given him this permit, were not at work.
In a report from the Institute for Justice, Communications Coordinator, Matt Powers explains that Roundtree is not alone.
Cities across the country often impose strict regulations that make it nearly impossible for food trucks to operate. In 2011, IJ launched its National Street Vending Initiative to fight these laws. In Baltimore, the Institute for Justice (IJ) is challenging a ban on food trucks parking within 300-foot of a brick-and-mortar business that sells the same type of food. In Chicago, IJ is challenging regulations that bans food trucks from operating within 200 feet of a brick-and-mortar business serving food and forces them to install GPS tracking devices that broadcast their every move. And IJ is challenging a Louisville, Kentucky, law banning food trucks from operating within 150 feet of any restaurant selling similar food.
These strict regulations are ostensibly designed for food safety, but in reality, serve to raise revenue for the state and limit established restaurants’ competition. They also stifle economic growth.
As the IJ noted:
The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad) It is not only during times of crisis that food trucks contribute to their communities. According to IJ’s report Streets of Dreams mobile vending businesses help people escape poverty and unemployment through affordable start-up costs which creates the initial economic opportunity for upward mobility. IJ’s report, Seven Myths and Realities found the presence of food trucks can actually help local restaurant industries by attracting new customers and serving as incubators for new restaurants. Cities should embrace food trucks and liberate them from onerous regulations so they can enjoy the benefits these businesses bring.
When people in need are denied food they are willing to purchase because government workers aren’t in the office to sell the maker of that food a permission slip, something is wrong in the land of the free.
As TFTP reported earlier this month, this problem is everywhere. It stifles local economic growth, persecutes the poor the hardest, and turns hard-working entrepreneurs into criminals, ripe for the extortion of state.
Luckily, thanks to Martin Flores, who filmed an innocent hot dog vendor named Beto get robbed by a Berkeley police officer for selling hot dogs, Americans are seeing the harsh reality that is making a living in a police state.

By Rich Mitchell
The Fox News Channel is extending its primetime lineup into the 11 pm hour with “Fox News @ Night” hosted by Bill Hemmer’s current co-host Shannon Bream.
The new show, which will air on Oct. 30, will cover current events in a live “hard news” format extending the network’s primetime lineup by an hour.
“For the past decade, Shannon’s insight into the inner workings of the Supreme Court and Washington has made her a major asset to our news division,” Fox News president Jay Wallace said in a statement. “Her experience, coupled with the relationship she has with our viewers, offers a perfect fit for the anchor position at 11 p.m. ET as we extend our live primetime programming.”
Shannon joined Fox News in 2007 and focused on covering elections and the Supreme Court until she joined Bill Hemmer on “America’s Newsroom” in January of 2017.
“It has been an honor to work alongside the hardest-working team in the news business for the past 10 years. I am delighted to bring our audience an hour of captivating television, providing viewers with a recap of the day’s most important stories and the latest breaking news,” Bream said.
Bream also hosts “Livin’ the Bream,” a podcast focused on inspirational stories, personal anecdotes and an insider’s perspective on actions and rulings from the high court.
Sandra Smith will permanently join Hemmer to co-host “America’s Newsroom” at 9 am.

If you grew up in the 90’s you are probably more than familiar with the franchise Goosebumps. Well now there is an upcoming movie based on these nostalgic books that brings all the old monsters to life.
 
The trailer for the film was released on Wednesday and seems to almost have a Jumanji type vibe. Jack Black plays a fictional version of the writer of the series, R.L. Stine. Stine gets a new neighbor next door that hopes to win the heart of Stine’s daughter. In doing so, he accidentally releases all of the horrifying monsters locked inside Stine’s original manuscripts.
 
From there it seems to seem like Jumanji like I was saying earlier. They all must capture the monsters that have escaped by forcing them back into the book.
 
Being that I loved these books as a kid, I’ll defiantly give it a chance, but who’s to say it’ll be good. It might just be another lame attempt at remaking something that was already amazing. The references to monsters so far though include:
 
The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena
 
My Best Friend is Invisible
 
The Giant Praying Mantis from A Shocker on Shock Street
 
The Werewolf of Fever Swamp
 
Why I’m Afraid of Bees
 
The plant from Stay Out of the Basement
 
Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes
 
and my favorite Slappy from Night of the Living Dummy
 
 
I’m crossing my fingers that it’ll be good. Check out the trailer below and share it with your friends!

","Amid Scandal, N.C.A.A. Forms Commission to Reform Men’s Basketball","The commission’s members include Jeremy Foley, who retired last year as Florida’s athletic director; Mary Sue Coleman, president of the Association of American Universities; and Gene Smith, Ohio State’s athletic director.
The group will examine three broad areas, according to the N.C.A.A.:
■ The N.C.A.A.’s fundamental regulatory arrangement, which requires colleges and universities to self-police and police one another, a model that, Emmert said, had failed in this instance.
■ The rules regarding three interrelated institutions that were crucial to the scandal outlined by federal authorities: apparel companies, nonscholastic basketball programs and agents. The three main apparel companies — Nike, Adidas and Under Armour — sponsor most of the high-profile teams as well as their own leagues for teenage players that exist outside the high school structure. Players who are, or wish to be, college athletes are barred from signing with apparel companies, but agents and other middlemen are widely suspected of connecting players and companies under the table, including through A.A.U. teams; one complaint alleged that an Adidas official had conspired to pay three players to commit to college programs sponsored by Adidas. As of now, college basketball players also cannot sign with agents.
■ The N.C.A.A.’s relationship to the N.B.A., and the N.B.A. rule, initiated more than a decade ago, barring players from entering the league until they are 19 or one year removed from high school. The so-called one-and-done rule leads the best high school prospects to play college basketball for just one season, under little pretense that they are interested in other aspects of college.

“We have a model at the N.C.A.A. that’s predicated upon students wanting to be students — that they want to be college students, they want to participate in a college experience, and they want to play college basketball — and their desire to play in the N.B.A. is subordinate to that,” Emmert said. “A model that forces somebody to go to college who has no interest in being in college is fundamentally flawed.”
N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver said in an email that the league was “impressed by the caliber and depth of experience of the Commission” and was “willing to provide any input it may seek from the N.B.A.” He added that the league was continuing to discuss the one-and-done rule.
Emmert, who will sit on the commission alongside the former N.B.A. stars David Robinson and Grant Hill, said that in his personal view prospects should be able to go straight from high school to the N.B.A.
But he drew the line at changes to the amateur model, which prevents colleges from compensating athletes beyond scholarships and related costs. While he declined to speak for the commission, its members do not include any public critics of amateurism, and some — such as the Rev. John I. Jenkins, the president of Notre Dame — are outspoken supporters.

“Our model of sport, and I don’t know anybody in higher education leadership positions who disagrees, is predicated on the fact that student-athletes are not employees of universities,” Emmert said. “If we’re paying someone $100,000, that’s twice the household income of America. I don’t know how that person’s not an employee.”
Emmert confirmed that he and the rest of the N.C.A.A. office in Indianapolis learned about the yearslong federal probe from news media reports. But if the criminal investigation surprised him, not all of the allegations did.
“There’s always been rumors and innuendo that swirled around about this kind of behavior,” he said. “I think one of the most disturbing elements of this whole circumstance is it seems to have uncovered, at least in these cases, a code of silence — that people who were aware of these things weren’t coming forward.”",1

",Facebook Could Start Using Facial Recognition to Verify Who You Are,"By Josie Wales
While Facebook has quietly been developing its facial recognition software for Aloha, a controversial video chat device set to debut in May 2018, the company is reportedly testing “a facial recognition feature to help secure your account,” according to TheNextWeb’s Matt Navarro, who posted a screenshot of the new feature on Twitter.
Facebook confirmed the limited rollout of the software, telling Techcrunch:
We are testing a new feature for people who want to quickly and easily verify account ownership during the account recovery process. This optional feature is available only on devices you’ve already used to log in. It is another step, alongside two-factor authentication via SMS, that were taking to make sure account owners can confirm their identity.
The feature will likely be available to more users once developers are satisfied with the product’s reliability, but no other details are available at this time regarding the timeline or implementation.

",Bob Corker Says Trump’s Recklessness Threatens ‘World War III’,"The senator, Mr. Trump said, had “begged” for his endorsement. “I said ‘NO’ and he dropped out (said he could not win without my endorsement),” the president wrote. He also said that Mr. Corker had asked to be secretary of state. “I said ‘NO THANKS,’” he wrote.
Mr. Corker flatly disputed that account, saying Mr. Trump had urged him to run again, and promised to endorse him if he did. But the exchange laid bare a deeper rift: The senator views Mr. Trump as given to irresponsible outbursts — a political novice who has failed to make the transition from show business.
Mr. Trump poses such an acute risk, the senator said, that a coterie of senior administration officials must protect him from his own instincts. “I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it’s a situation of trying to contain him,” Mr. Corker said in a telephone interview.
The deeply personal back-and-forth will almost certainly rupture what had been a friendship with a fellow real estate developer turned elected official, one of the few genuine relationships Mr. Trump had developed on Capitol Hill. Still, even as he leveled his stinging accusations, Mr. Corker repeatedly said on Sunday that he liked Mr. Trump, until now an occasional golf partner, and wished him “no harm.”
The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Mr. Corker’s remarks.
Mr. Trump’s feud with Mr. Corker is particularly perilous given that the president has little margin for error as he tries to pass a landmark overhaul of the tax code — his best, and perhaps last, hope of producing a major legislative achievement this year.
If Senate Democrats end up unified in opposition to the promised tax bill, Mr. Trump could lose the support of only two of the Senate’s 52 Republicans to pass it. That is the same challenging math that Mr. Trump and Senate Republican leaders faced in their failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
Mr. Corker could also play a key role if Mr. Trump follows through on his threat to “decertify” the Iran nuclear deal, kicking to Congress the issue of whether to restore sanctions on Tehran and effectively scuttle the pact.

Republicans could hold off on sanctions but use the threat of them to force Iran back to the negotiating table — a strategy being advocated by Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican. But that approach could leave the United States isolated, and it will be up to Mr. Corker to balance opposition to the deal with the wishes of those, including some of Mr. Trump’s own aides, who want to change the accord but not blow it up.
Beyond the Iran deal, Mr. Corker’s committee holds confirmation hearings on Mr. Trump’s ambassadorial appointments. If the president were to oust Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state, as some expect, Mr. Corker would lead the hearings on Mr. Trump’s nominee for the post.
In a 25-minute conversation, Mr. Corker, speaking carefully and purposefully, seemed to almost find cathartic satisfaction by portraying Mr. Trump in terms that most senior Republicans use only in private.
The senator, who is close to Mr. Tillerson, invoked comments that the president made on Twitter last weekend in which he appeared to undercut Mr. Tillerson’s negotiations with North Korea.
“A lot of people think that there is some kind of ‘good cop, bad cop’ act underway, but that’s just not true,” Mr. Corker said.
Without offering specifics, he said Mr. Trump had repeatedly undermined diplomacy with his Twitter fingers. “I know he has hurt, in several instances, he’s hurt us as it relates to negotiations that were underway by tweeting things out,” Mr. Corker said.

All but inviting his colleagues to join him in speaking out about the president, Mr. Corker said his concerns about Mr. Trump were shared by nearly every Senate Republican.
“Look, except for a few people, the vast majority of our caucus understands what we’re dealing with here,” he said, adding that “of course they understand the volatility that we’re dealing with and the tremendous amount of work that it takes by people around him to keep him in the middle of the road.”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
As for the tweets that set off the feud on Sunday morning, Mr. Corker expressed a measure of powerlessness.
“I don’t know why the president tweets out things that are not true,” he said. “You know he does it, everyone knows he does it, but he does.”
The senator recalled four conversations this year, a mix of in-person meetings and phone calls, in which he said the president had encouraged him to run for re-election. Mr. Trump, he said, repeatedly indicated he wanted to come to Tennessee for an early rally on Mr. Corker’s behalf and even telephoned him last Monday to try to get him to reconsider his decision to retire.
“When I told him that that just wasn’t in the cards, he said, ‘You know, if you run, I’ll endorse you.’ I said, ‘Mr. President, it’s just not in the cards; I’ve already made a decision.’ So then we began talking about other candidates that were running.”
One of the most prominent establishment-aligned Republicans to develop a relationship with Mr. Trump, the senator said he did not regret standing with him during the campaign last year.
“I would compliment him on things that he did well, and I’d criticize things that were inappropriate,” he said. “So it’s been really the same all the way through.”
A former mayor of Chattanooga who became wealthy in construction, Mr. Corker, 65, has carved out a reputation over two terms in the Senate as a reliable, but not overly partisan, Republican.
While he opposed President Barack Obama’s divisive nuclear deal with Iran, he did not prevent it from coming to a vote on the Senate floor, which exposed him to fierce fire from conservatives, who blamed him for its passage.

Mr. Trump picked up on that theme hours after his initial tweets, writing that “Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that’s about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!”
Mr. Corker was briefly a candidate to be Mr. Trump’s running mate in 2016, but he withdrew his name from consideration and later expressed ambivalence about Mr. Trump’s campaign, in part because he said he found it frustrating to discuss foreign policy with him.
To some extent, the rift between the two men had been building for months, as Mr. Corker repeatedly pointed out on Sunday to argue that his criticism was not merely that of a man liberated from facing the voters again.
After a report last week that Mr. Tillerson had once referred to Mr. Trump as a “moron,” Mr. Corker told reporters that Mr. Tillerson was one of three officials helping to “separate our country from chaos.” Those remarks were repeated on “Fox News Sunday,” which may have prompted Mr. Trump’s outburst.
In August, after Mr. Trump’s equivocal response to the deadly clashes in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Corker told reporters that the president “has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.”
He said on Sunday that he had made all those comments deliberately, aiming them at “an audience of one, plus those people who are closely working around with him, what I would call the good guys.” He was referring to Mr. Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly.
“As long as there are people like that around him who are able to talk him down when he gets spun up, you know, calm him down and continue to work with him before a decision gets made, I think we’ll be fine,” he said.
Mr. Corker would not directly answer when asked whether he thought Mr. Trump was fit for the presidency. But he did say that the commander in chief was not fully aware of the power of his office.
“I don’t think he appreciates that when the president of the United States speaks and says the things that he does, the impact that it has around the world, especially in the region that he’s addressing,” he said. “And so, yeah, it’s concerning to me.”",1

In the past few months, the world has been inundated with stories of devastating natural disasters which have caused waves of catastrophe across parts of North and Central America and Asia. These events have brought into sharp relief how vulnerable and fragile humanity is when faced with the shocking force of the planet’s natural ebbs and flows.

The 'Ring of Fire' is Shaking Violently - Massive Uptick in Earthquakes

According to experts, it is evident that the Earth is currently undergoing some major shifts. Potentially, the most vulnerable part of the Earth is the region known as the Pacific ring of fire which lies on the perimeter of the Pacific Ocean basin. The Pacific ring of fire is an area of intense seismic activity which is populated by an enormous circle of almost five hundred volcanoes, the majority of which are active to some degree. Signs suggest that this vast region of the Earth, which is responsible for the vast majority of earthquakes and volcanic activity on the planet, is about to undergo a major shift which could spell catastrophe for millions of people who live in its vicinity.
 
Recently, more than ten thousand people were ordered to leave their homes on the Melanesian island of Vanuatu which lies on the south western perimeter of the ring of fire owing to the serious eruptions of Mount Manaro. It is believed that this eruption will be the first in a series of volcanic explosions over the next couple of months with Mount Agung in Bali showing clear signs that it will also erupt in the very near future.
 
<img src=""http://en.es-static.us/upl/2015/12/hawaii_volcano.jpg"">
 
The news that Oceania is becoming affected by the shifts in the Earth’s core follows devastating scenes across North and South America following an unusual spate of volcanic activity. Mexico was recently struck with a catastrophic eruption of the Popocatépetl volcano which lies to the south-east of Mexico City. The eruption triggered two devastating earthquakes which caused significant damage to the city and an enormous loss of life. Meanwhile, in Costa Rica, there have been three significant volcanic eruptions in the past year and a series of earthquakes.
 
<img src=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C9ZZYrsWsAADvwS.jpg"">
 
The seismic events in Mexico were followed by a burst of earthquakes in the United States, with several being detected off the coast of California giving rise to fears that the build-up of pressure on the San Andreas fault is coming to a potentially catastrophic conclusion. The United States is considered to be particularly vulnerable to the shifts in seismic activity owing to the presence of the super volcano in Yellowstone national park which has been showing signs of unusual activity with a swarm of minor earthquakes in recent months. In addition to the presence of Yellowstone and the San Andreas fault line, the United States is also home to the Cascadia subduction zone which has the potential to produce a mega-thrust earthquake reaching a magnitude of more than nine on the Richter scale which could devastate the coast of Washington State, Oregon, and British Colombia.

Final Thoughts
 
The renewed bursts of seismic activity all over the world could prove catastrophic for human beings and serves to demonstrate how fragile human beings truly when confronted with the forces of nature and how helpless even the most powerful governments in the world are to protect their citizens against the power of the Earth. Given the potential for serious disaster all over the world, it would now be wise for everyone to prepare for worst case scenarios to protect themselves and their families from the destruction caused by natural disasters as recent events have shown that the governments of the world are simply not equipped to deal with the protection of their citizens in the midst of devastating natural disasters.

","Puig Powers Dodgers to 8-5 Win Over D-Backs, 2-0 Series Lead","The Dodgers have the majors' biggest payroll, but their offense is coming from players of all salaries and pedigrees. And even when the heart of the Dodgers' order produced little in Game 2, their 6-7-8 hitters — Forsythe, Barnes and Puig — were spectacular.
""We've got a lot of good players, and a lot of depth,"" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. ""There are so many guys in our lineup that can hurt you. I don't know how many times they were on base, but (the batters in the) 6, 7, 8 spot, those guys were on base all night, being productive, driving runs in.""
The trio reached base a combined nine times, and Los Angeles turned an early 2-0 deficit into a 7-2 advantage with three rallies, capped by a four-run surge in the fifth.
Barnes, usually the Dodgers' backup catcher, reached base three times and got the night's biggest hit with that fifth-inning double. As for Puig, he has five hits, four RBIs and an uncountable number of tongue-wags, bat-licks and obscure celebratory gestures in just two games.
""It tells you that this team is prepared,"" said Forsythe, who scored three runs in the second playoff game of his career. ""The big thing for us is the guys that aren't in (the lineup every day) are wanting to prove something, and I think that gives them a little added edge. They come out with a chip on their shoulder, and they want to get the job done. They're not scared to do it. They want to do it.""
Paul Goldschmidt hit a two-run homer in the first inning and Brandon Drury added a pinch-hit, three-run shot in the seventh, but the Diamondbacks are on the brink of elimination after Robbie Ray and reliever Jimmie Sherfy couldn't contain the Dodgers' lineup.
Arizona actually has six homers in the series to just one by the Dodgers, who scored eight runs in Game 2 with only one extra-base hit.

""These games are dogfights, so it's going to take a team effort and a collective unit,"" Barnes said. ""We've been doing this all year.""
Game 3 of the best-of-five matchup is Monday at Chase Field. Arizona ace Zack Greinke will attempt to save the season when he faces his former teammates with the Dodgers, who counter with late-season acquisition Yu Darvish.

Greinke is probably the Diamondbacks' best chance to stop the Dodgers from scoring their way out of every problem.
""If you've got to pick one guy to stop this situation we're in, I think we've found the right guy in Zack Greinke,"" Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.
Ray had been outstanding in five regular-season starts against the Dodgers, but he had just two days of rest after pitching in relief during Arizona's wild-card win over Colorado, and the left-hander struggled mightily with his control from the first inning.
Ray walked four of nine batters early on, but the Dodgers didn't get their first hit until Forsythe, Barnes and Puig delivered consecutive singles in the fourth in a go-ahead rally.
""I think with the wild-card game, it kind of threw things out of whack a little bit, but that's the format,"" said reliever Archie Bradley, who struck out Jansen in a rare at-bat for the Dodgers closer. ""You have to win that game to get here. So it's about trying to use this off day the best we can to get healthy. The series is not over.""
Drury kept it close with his no-doubt shot in the seventh on Brandon Morrow's first pitch, but the Dodgers rallied for another run in the bottom half.
Roberts went to Jansen after Daniel Descalso's one-out double off Josh Fields in the eighth, and the vaunted closer reprised his multiple-inning dominance from last October, mowing down five straight batters, getting David Peralta on a groundout to end it.

NO JT NO PROBLEM
Justin Turner drove in five runs in the Dodgers' 9-5 victory in Game 1, which began with a four-run first inning against Arizona's Taijuan Walker. Turner went 1 for 4 in Game 2 and popped out with the bases loaded to end the seventh, but the Dodgers didn't even need their slugging third baseman.
SHORT START
Rich Hill made it through just four innings for the Dodgers, yielding three hits and three walks. The veteran struggled with his control and never found a groove, but stranded runners in scoring position in the second and third innings to keep it close.
AMPLE WORK
Kenta Maeda got the victory by getting three outs of middle relief. The Japanese right-hander didn't make the Division Series rotation, but Roberts plans to use the 13-game winner as a specialist against right-handed batters.
BIG CROWD
With 54,726 fans in attendance, the Dodgers had their largest crowd in Chavez Ravine since 2012, before renovations to the venerable stadium. The crowd also was one of the season's loudest, egged on by Puig's enthusiasm and by Hill, who held up a cardboard sign in the seventh inning exhorting fans to get loud.
UP NEXT
Greinke couldn't make it through four innings in the Diamondbacks' wild-card game, but nobody around the Dodgers doubts the $206.5 million right-hander who won 51 games in three years with Los Angeles. Darvish went 4-3 with a 3.44 ERA in two months with the Dodgers, but the Japanese star yielded just one earned run in 19 1/3 innings over his final three starts before the postseason.

SD 3 SF 2
It was only fitting that Matt Cain would pitch well in his farewell; it was only fitting that the Giants would tag their teammate with another ND. You are what you is, like FZ sez, and Matt Cain is (was) a hard-luck pitcher. At the same time, he had an outstanding career, and his exploits will forever be etched in SFG lore. The fans got their celebration today, desperately needed in this un-celebratory season, and the Tennessee Stud got a proper send-off. Bit of drama in the 5th, his final frame, after walking the leadoff man he got a visit from Boch, the crowd booed, then the skipper left him in, and then they cheered. Matty did his part: twelve pitches to three batters for another scoreless inning.
Cain’s line was 5 IP (18 batters, 73 pitches), 2 H 1 W, 4 K, and zero runs allowed in his 331st start. He turns 33 tomorrow having pitched professionally since he was 17 years old, all in the Giants organization, making his major league debut in 2005.
The Giants had a 1-0 lead after the 5th when Cain was pulled. The Rockies tied it in the 6th. The Giants went ahead in the 7th. They took a 2-1 lead to the 9th, and with two strikes, two outs, and two on, a two-bagger scored two and the Rockies went ahead 3-2. That was the final–the Giants lose in Cain’s last start. But that’s the story of 2017. It will be over soon, I promise.
Matt Cain helped the Giants to a whole heap of wins over the years even if he didn’t get the ‘W’ tag after each one. He was near tears in his post-game chat with AmyG, and that’s only fitting.
–M.C.
p.s. Thanks to the real Matt Cain for inspiring me to spill lots of digital ink over the years!
p.p.s. Apologies to John Updike.

If legendary wrestling announcer Jim Ross had scripted his return to WrestleMania after a four-year exile, it wouldn't have gone much better. Tens of thousands of fans stood as one to cheer him, welcoming him back into the fold. There was a spot waiting for him at the announcer's table for him at the main event too, a personal request from the legendary Undertaker, who wanted Ross to voice his final battle.
But even as Ross proved, once again, that he still has it—that he can still bring context to carnage—it all felt empty somehow. Something was missing.
Someone.
Jan Ross was supposed to be there with him as he walked the red carpet. His wife loved WrestleMania weekend—the pomp, the chance to wear her beloved Louis Vuitton and, most importantly, a chance to see their extended wrestling family. She called it ""coming home"" and was excited for Ross to renew his relationship with the WWE on a part-time basis.
Then one night in March, Jan was heading back from the gym on her Vespa. She was a fitness freak, the opposite of her husband—a drinker, a smoker, an eater of fried foods. He had always figured he was destined to depart this earth first. But that night, a car didn't see her in the dark and she wasn't wearing a helmet. She was thrown from her vehicle as it caught fire.
""She was my best friend. Soulmate. We went through everything together, including my three bouts of Bell's palsy,"" Ross says. ""My future was always with her. She'd built us a wonderful home.""
In an instant, that future was gone.
Adrift, he did the only thing he knew to do. Less than two weeks after the accident, he went to Orlando, to WrestleMania, to what he knows best.
""I had to do what I've done my whole life—roll my sleeves up and reassess my situation,"" says the 65-year-old Ross. ""It's all about moving forward. I don't plan on becoming a hermit and sitting in a darkened room in my home with a clicker in my hand, channel-surfing.
""When I went to WrestleMania, it was very raw. I was kind of blocking stuff out. Trying not to slow down. I'm still figuring this out, this widower thing. It was just hard, because she was everything. I needed that week.""
Ross had sacrificed two previous marriages to the wrestling gods, damaged his relationships with his daughters, driven himself to drinking and drugs. In his time of need, surely, the business he loved would be there to lift him up and hold him steady?
""We all knew that Jim was there because it was what Jan would have wanted, and it helped him to do what he does best: be in his element and be around people he knows love him,"" says announcer Jeremy Borash, who often opens for Ross on his one-man show. ""It was therapeutic for him to be there, as hard as it probably was.
""It wasn't just the show. It was after the show, before the show. Every minute it's on his mind. As friends and supporters, it was our job to comfort him and let him know it was OK to cry and he's got people who will cry right there with him. I think it was the right place to be for him at that point.""

When Undertaker slowly made his way to the ring to wrestle Roman Reigns that night, Ross was where he needed to be, calling his first match for WWE in four years.
He'd come home.
His first job in the wrestling business was babysitter—only the baby in question was 64 years old, blind as a bat and all too often hammered on his daily pint of whiskey.
Leroy McGuirk had been both a national champion wrestler and editor of the student newspaper at Oklahoma State in the early 1930s. He ruled the mats as a professional too, before losing both his good eye and his career in a car crash in 1950.
By the mid-1970s, he was mostly just trouble. And 22-year-old Ross' job was to get him to the office in a big, black Cadillac, make sure he was well-supplied with liquor and keep him from killing any of the wrestlers brazen enough to try to date his pretty, inexplicably named daughter, Mike.
Along the way, between fits and cigars, he found time to pass on the accumulated tradecraft of a lifetime. McGuirk's partner was Bill Watts, an enormous, cantankerous wrestler who had a specific vision for the business and a gift for formatting television to keep fans guessing.

""My eyes were wide-open, and it was such a cool thing,"" Ross says. ""The psychology and the logistics and the passion. And I was working under two real cerebral guys. They were academicians. They weren't broken-nosed, scar-faced ex-bouncers. They were college guys. They were badasses too, don't get me wrong. But they were more than that. They were Renaissance men in my view, and I was young and impressionable. I was fresh off the farm, man.""
Ross may have technically grown up in the 1960s, a time of great unrest, uncertainty and civil uprising. But in Westville, Oklahoma, you'd have hardly noticed. That was farm country, where the boys wore crewcuts and called folks sir or ma'am and the girls wore dresses and studied home economics. The happenings in California or Detroit were a world away, something that happened on television far from home.
Maybe that's what attracted him to the wrestling business, an industry of iconoclasts and troublemakers, a place where propriety was the last thing on anyone's mind. What started as a fraternity charity fundraiser turned into a lifelong obsession. Once Ross got the wrestling bug, there was no turning back.
Ross was a referee, helped out in the office and even promoted some shows of his own. Riding with veterans like Skandor Akbar and Danny Hodge on the long, desolate state roads connecting Oklahoma to Louisiana and beyond, he learned an awful lot about an industry he'd come to love. Riding with some of the other boys, he learned more esoteric skills that were no less important to making it in the business.

""The older guys would ride with me and pay me two cents a mile,"" Ross remembers. ""That was the going rate. When you're making $25 a day and going on these long trips, that transportation money is key. It keeps you in the game. ...
""They would smoke weed in my car, and I learned to roll a joint while steering the car with my legs. Bodily excretions were commonplace, and there was an ongoing contest to see who could get the biggest reaction passing gas. I learned early on to sell it real big and hope they got their satisfaction from it. I learned to work the workers.""
In Watts' Mid-South Wrestling, legitimate athleticism was prized and wrestlers had to be as big and as tough as the men pouring off the oil fields to watch them perform. Credibility was everything. A wrestler could scrap with fans in the arena or at the bar after the show—but he better not lose. That was a one-way ticket to the unemployment line.
It's an ethos that rubbed off on Ross and became the guiding force in his career. Whether the wrestler in the ring is a former All-American standout or a man dressed up as a giant clown, he is intent on treating every match like it mattered.
""I treat it like an athletic contest,"" Ross says. ""To help suspend your disbelief and get caught up in it like a legitimate contest as best we can. I want to maintain the integrity. Some people think bad acting or bad comedy is entertainment. I think athletic pro wrestling is entertaining.
""I believe that most fans are entertained by the athletes and the compelling stories that are told in the ring. That's what I've built my game around. I try to extend the suspension of disbelief so that whoever is watching can enjoy the experience.""
In the late 1980s, wrestling went through a seismic change. Where there had once been dozens of regional territories, a fierce battle of attrition left only two. ""Down South"" was Ted Turner's World Championship Wrestling. ""New York"" was Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation.
Ross wowed wrestling fans and analysts ""down south,"" establishing himself as the top performer in his field, winning the Wrestling Observer Newsletter award as ""Best Announcer"" six years running.

""He's the best commentator in the history of wrestling,"" wrestling legend Ric Flair says. ""I'm the only one who can make that statement because I've known them all. I have known every announcer in the past 45 years. Some were good, some were bad. Gordon Solie was great. Mean Gene was great. Jim Ross was the greatest.""
Corporate executives were less impressed, especially new WCW head honcho Eric Bischoff, who pulled Ross from the air in 1993, proclaiming him a bad fit for a national broadcast.
""The story they sold internally is that I was too regional,"" Ross says. ""On a station based out of Georgia that had built a reputation on Andy Griffith reruns, Braves baseball and rassling. And I'm too Southern. OK.""
That left the proud Oklahoman only one option if he wanted to make a living in the wrestling business. The man who was too southern to stay ""down south"" was going to have to wow them in ""New York.""
Ross was not a popular man when he first started in WWE back in 1993. It had started well enough, when a two-hour drive from Atlanta to Augusta to meet Vince McMahon paid immediate dividends. Ross was still working in the office ""down south"" but dreaming of a return to the air. He made his best pitch to McMahon, and the two immediately hit it off.
""We got engaged in a conversation that ended up lasting almost three hours, just standing in the parking lot outside the arena,"" Ross says. ""To this day, people say he'd never done that before or since. He just walked out of the tapings. And he's usually very hands-on.
""We had a lot in common—mainly our passion for the business. I think he sensed it and had heard I had a strong work ethic. And lord knows he does. Stronger than anybody I've ever been around. He's a freak. Amazing.""
It was a different story when Ross relocated, new wife Jan in tow, to Connecticut to start in wrestling's big leagues. The cold shoulders and colder stares from entrenched insiders like ""Lord"" Alfred Hayes were one thing. Those could be ignored or overcome. It's harder to pretend the ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage doesn't have his hand wrapped around your throat and harder yet to pretend he isn't squeezing.

As Ross wrote in his memoir Slobberknocker, Savage hadn't enjoyed being called in to do extra promotional videos on his off time. Ross hadn't enjoyed, well, much of anything about his new job and wasn't shy about telling anyone who'd listen. Within months, McMahon called him into the office to talk. When he saw the head of human relations was also in the room, Ross knew his days were numbered.
""I don't know if I was ever happy,"" Ross says. ""I wasn't particularly happy to move from Atlanta to Wilton, Connecticut. I was the ace at WCW. And now I was doing a little piece of this and a piece of that.
""My decision-making at times was suspect. Around the office, I was outspoken, and sometimes it's best to be seen and not heard. Sometimes I don't always follow that guidance. It wasn't a great cultural fit at the time. My biggest problem was not knowing my audience. It was a maturity thing.""
A year later, McMahon called him like nothing had happened at all. This time, Ross was ready.

Wrestling fans know Ross as the iconic voice of the Attitude Era, the rollicking, crude wrestling of the late '90s. Together with his partner, Jerry ""The King"" Lawler, he brought the matches of ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, The Rock and D-Generation X to life.
""We were able to develop chemistry almost immediately,"" Ross says. ""I was a preparation freak, and he was just the opposite. He was just such a natural talent with amazing instincts. But our philosophy was the same. When I tossed him something, he knew what pitch was coming. He knew where we were going and was ready to swing. And we had a great product to call and were given the opportunity by management to do our thing. They trusted our instincts.""
Ross would eventually join McMahon's inner circle, hanging out around the pool at his home every weekend to plot the course of wrestling's mothership. As the vice president of talent relations, he was a key player in reinventing the WWE roster for the Attitude Era.
""He assembled the roster. Now he had to answer to Vince, and Vince is very smart and knows what he wants,"" longtime wrestling executive Terry Taylor says. ""But it was J.R. who had to make the deals happen and had to know how to motivate somebody, incentivize somebody. In that era, you had WCW offering guaranteed contracts that paid the same whether you worked or not, whether you were successful or not. J.R had to compete with that, and all he had was the power of opportunity.""
The roster soon reflected Ross in many ways, full of underdogs who made up in passion for the industry what they lacked in natural talent. For years, WWE had been a collection of generically handsome, muscular good guys like Lex Luger and circus-freak bad guys, like Yokozuna. Ross was able to break the mold a bit, to give people who wouldn't ordinarily get a shot at wrestling's big leagues a foot in the door.
Once there, Ross made it a point to treat talent fairly. If you were great, he rewarded you. If you were awful, he told you so, straight up, always sure to offer constructive ideas to go along with each critique.
""He took such great care of us,"" Matt Hardy remembers. ""One thing that was amazing about J.R. is that he always gave it to you straight. That doesn't always happen in wrestling. He never gave you an answer he thought you wanted to hear. He said what he actually thought.
""We had a great string of matches on the WWE Live events for about a month straight. And J.R actually started bonusing us. Because we were having great matches. We were just breaking in and on the lower end of the pay scale. Those bonuses were a big deal. He was looking out for us, because we were J.R. guys.""
While Steve Austin and The Rock became the signature stars of the Ross era, it was Mick Foley who best personified the impact his dogged determination had on WWE. Vince, after years of rejecting Foley outright, let Ross sign him as an object lesson. As Ross writes in his new book Slobberknocker, McMahon told him ""I want you to learn how it feels to have your heart broken by a character you think is going to be a star—and then ends up being the s--ts.""
Sometimes those kinds of predictions are self-fulfilling, especially when voiced by someone like McMahon who had the power to make them come true. But Foley and Ross were intent on proving he belonged and saw the perfect opportunity with a rare, 60 Minutes-style taped interview that aired over four weeks on WWE Raw.
""It was a game-changer,"" Foley says. ""As important as it was for fans to get to know and appreciate the character, it was even more important that Mr. McMahon appreciated the character. It was the moment where I felt he really got on board with the character.
""Jim Ross was such a big part of bringing that out because he has such great credibility with our fans, his questions were really probing, and not to belittle other people, but he didn't do these things with a wink and a nod. He was completely involved, completely absorbed in the moment. I think that is why he is in my opinion the premier person to ever call pro wrestling matches.""
His new role as McMahon's right-hand man not only allowed Ross to maximize his potential, but it also pushed Jan into a more prominent role in the company, where she quickly thrived. Ross compared her often to a coach's wife, someone who could charm, entertain and wow the diverse WWE roster. Everyone from The Rock to Kurt Angle visited their home, and she did her best to tailor the experience for each wrestler.
""I remember her making a ham and a chicken for Big Show,"" Ross says. ""And she made homemade biscuits with apple butter. He's a South Carolinian, and apple butter is a staple for us southerners. He and I finished off a whole jar. She didn't have to go out and find apple butter in Connecticut. But she wanted every talent that came to our home to feel special.""
After long weeks on the road, the wrestlers loved spending the night with the Ross family instead of at a hotel. They could put their feet up and enjoy a home-cooked meal. If Jan really liked a wrestler, like Steve Austin, she'd even wash his gear. Everyone was made to feel like they mattered.
""Sometimes they had heard my speeches and my coaching up and critiques to where they were sick of it,"" Ross admits. ""She was invaluable there. I don't think she'll ever get the credit she deserves for her role in a key time in company history. She could soothe the savage beast a little bit. Sometimes they needed a female perspective. She was a great listener and a great conversationalist. She would remember their wives' names, their kids, their mom and dad. That was her.""
Days for Ross were often 14 hours long, and weekends were fair game. McMahon pushed himself to work an inhuman schedule, and his key employees were expected to match him step for step. The head of talent relations isn't normally beloved. They make a lot of key decisions, both about how a wrestler is going to be used, but also how they are going to get paid.
""He could not have married a better person,"" Flair says. ""God only knows she had to have a lot of patience to put up with Jim's schedule. It's brutal. Talent relations is an unbearable job in the WWE because you have some people who are men, some people who are women and some men and women who are little kids. Jim Ross had to handle 80 kids a day. ... He had to put up with the whining and the bitching and everything else.""
Flair often took credit for setting the two up, though truth be told he and Ross happened to be on the same flight Jan worked in 1991.
""Here was this beautiful young lady, and Jim and I hadn't been to bed,"" Flair remembers. ""We started talking. I thought she was talking to me. She blew right by me to J.R. Next thing I knew they were dating, and there you go.
""What a wonderful, wonderful person. Any time anybody saw Jan, they smiled. I never knew Jan to have a bad word to say about anybody. She was just a wonderful person. I couldn't wait to see her. She was that fabulous.
""And being married to that Crown Royal-drinking son of a bitch couldn't have been too easy, either,"" he adds with a laugh.

Ross didn't know Foley was going to be thrown off the cage at Hell in the Cell back in 1998. And he didn't know he'd get back up only to come crashing down a second time.
""Good God almighty,"" he screamed after Undertaker tossed Foley 16 feet down onto the Spanish announce table. ""They've killed him! As God as my witness, he is broken in half.""
It's his most famous call, the one you often hear dubbed underneath sports highlights, the one he says people ask him about most often (sure enough, it comes up three times over a single weekend I am with him). People want to know what he knew and when he knew it.
The truth is, he had no idea what was coming.
Unlike fans who dig deep for the slightest clues about upcoming wrestling stories, Ross doesn't want to know what wrestlers are going to do during the match. He prefers to respond honestly and openly to whatever comes, letting his visceral reaction tell the story.
""He liked to see the match evolve,"" Foley says. ""If I had said, 'Hey Jim, don't be too surprised if my body comes flying off this massive cell structure,' he probably would have come up with something cool to say. But it wouldn't have been immortalized. It wouldn't have crossed over into pop culture at places like Bleacher Report and ESPN.
""If wrestling wasn't stigmatized to some degree, the sporting world would acknowledge that that call is every bit as good as 'The Giants win the pennant' and probably better. 'Do you believe in miracles' is a good call, but I'll still pick 'As God as my witness, he's broken in half.'
Wrestling is an often misunderstood art form. It's neither venal violence nor silly slapstick—though it can be both at times. Instead, it's a physical opera with silent but sophisticated narrative arcs explaining the human experience in pain and blood.
""Our only voice is the commentator's,"" Hardy says. ""And nobody did that better than Jim Ross. He would come to you before the match, not for details, but to ask what story we were trying to relay to the crowd. And he would build his commentary on that. When you're calling a wrestling match, it's a lot more than calling the moves by a certain name. It's about being able to relay the emotions that the competitors are feeling.
""The pain, the happiness, the sadness that they are feeling. The commentator has to relay that to the audience at home. J.R knew how to touch on an emotional nerve. He would get that story across so well, so the everyday Joe, the working man and woman, could understand it. And that was paramount in helping tell our stories.""
Ross gives voice to a wrestler's intent. Like all announcers, he can either enhance or destroy what a wrestler is trying to accomplish. Over the years, he's established a reputation as a master without peer.
""J.R. is very humble,"" says Taylor, who has known Ross since his days in Mid-South Wrestling 30 years ago. ""He'll tell you the greatest wrestling announcer ever was Gordon Solie. I don't know. Most of the great moments in modern wrestling history—whose voice is attached to them? Jim Ross.
""These iconic moments, the constant was J.R. The talent came and went. But the voice, emotion and passion attached to every one of those moments. It's unbelievable. What an impact he had on the business.""
The crowd roared as Jim Ross made his typically understated entrance at the Allstate Arena in the Chicago suburbs this May. Newly re-signed by WWE, he was doing a little of this and a little of that—about 30 dates over the course of a year was the plan. A ""little of that"" in this case was a match on NXT's live special between Tyler Bate and Pete Dunne, two impossibly young British wrestlers making their debut in the WWE's developmental league.
It was an absolute crackerjack contest, with Ross landing just the right amount of gravitas and credibility. Once he had struggled to fit in and do justice to the matches. In today's WWE, he received an ovation bigger than either wrestler's, and both were thrilled to have his voice on the soundtrack of the biggest match of their lives.

""I go to catering, and I see Tyler Bate sitting over here. I see Pete Dunne sitting over here. I say, 'You, come here. Get over here.' They don't know me from God-damned Adam,"" Ross says. ""I said, 'I want to talk to you boys.' Their eyes got this big. They are looking up at me. They're great kids. I love these two kids.
""I say, 'You need to understand this is probably the biggest night of your career. You've heard that all day, right? You believe that, right? Well, here's something you haven't heard. It's the biggest day of my career, too. I'm coming back to work, and I plan on kicking some ass tonight, so you little bastards better give me something to work with.'
""I wanted them to understand the opportunity they had doesn't come along all the time. The timing, the lay of the land, right place, right time. Wrestling is a funny genre in that regard. The table was set for them. It happens to all of us no matter what we do in our lifetime. We have to understand when there is an opportunity there to better our lives, to help us professionally, to give us a little comfort in our daily life, go for it. There is no guarantee it's gonna happen again.""
Ross has a knack for that brand of philosophizing, for putting someone at ease while, at the same time, making it exceedingly clear that the pressure was on. The kids delivered, and Ross did his part as well. When preparation meets opportunity, things tend to work out that way.
It was all people wanted to talk about the next day as Ross signed autographs before his appearance at Zanies, a comedy club that has had solid success booking wrestlers for special appearances when WWE brings a major event to town. Ross' ""Ringside"" is one of several such one-man shows—like his book, a perfect vehicle for a man who has a story about everyone and everything.
His is a career that stretches back more than 40 years, meaning Ross has yarns about four generations of superstars, from Andre The Giant to Ric Flair to ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin. He's an able but careful storyteller in any format. You don't last as a key player in the world's most powerful wrestling company without knowing just how hard you can push. Ross entertains but never burns bridges—though he's not afraid to shake them around a little bit.

Ross has a word or two for everyone who paid a $45 upcharge for VIP access and a chance to meet the voice of wrestling. He signs a variety of things, from a 20-year-old toy (""Where'd you get that? eBay?"") to a pair of sneakers. Every overweight man is ""big boy,"" every woman ""sweetheart."" He asks everyone their name and is impressed by what he hears back.
""I like Chicago,"" he tells one man. ""You have real names here. Mike, Joe, Bill.""
""I really like your podcast,"" Bill replies.
""At least somebody is listening,"" Ross deadpans in return.
When everyone has had their moment and snapped their selfies, Ross goes back to the dressing room to relax a bit before the show. There's a full bar, which helps. One of the guests is running behind, which doesn't.
There is a bit of the curmudgeon in Ross. He rants about millennials and the prevalence of cellphones glued to faces. He gets perturbed when his best dad jokes are wasted on a waitress who doesn't quite follow. But he loves the fans and they love him. If he doubted it before Jan's passing, he doesn't now. The outpouring of emotion is all too real. His pain is their pain.
The show ended up being great, a dream scenario for wrestling fans who he held in the palm of his hand. His book is much the same, a collection of vignettes, a greatest-hits collection of his best tall tales and truths.
For a moment, at least, he seems content.
There are still sucker punches that can take his breath away, even six months after Jan's tragic death. Like walking into his own home on the Tuesday after WrestleMania and realizing something was missing.
""Coming home was one of the hardest things I've ever done,"" Ross says. ""WrestleMania was like a family reunion. Family being both the fans and WWE folks. I embraced all that. It was a great comfort to me. I really needed it. I was so euphoric. I wasn't prepared for how I was going to feel when I got home. It was a totally empty house.""
The cure, for Ross, is work. He's as busy as he's been in years, calling wrestling and boxing, promoting his book. He doesn't want to slow down. Maybe because he fears what will happen when he does.
""I get asked all the time when I'm going to retire. I don't have any desire to retire,"" Ross says. ""To do what? My favorite thing in the world is to do commentary in this genre. Now that Jan's gone, I have a totally different attitude than any other time I've been in the business.
""People have to understand, I'm not as strong as people believe I am. I use my work for WWE, for AXS TV and New Japan, it's a defense mechanism. It's just a f--king defense mechanism that keeps me focused on positive things.
""So I'm not mired in self-pity. So I don't feel hopeless. I plan on working through this situation like I've done all the rest of my life. You always hear 'don't give up.' It's become more than a cliche. It's real now.""

(Before It's News)
By Bryan Dietzler
The Chicago Bears, fresh off a loss to division rival Green Bay, will host the Minnesota Vikings in their only Monday night appearance of the 2017 season. The Vikings are coming off a loss as well, 14-7 at the hands of division rival Detroit. They are desperately looking for a win. They come in with a record of 2-2 while the Bears have won just one game this season.
By now everyone knows that rookie quarterback Mitchell Trubisky will start Monday night. He replaces someone who could never quite do what the Bears needed him to do in Mike Glennon. The future is now, and it’s time they start to move forward. And with such a heavy investment in Mitch, it’s about time they did.
With this game being Trubisky’ s first start it will be a tough outing for the Bears’ passing game. It was already anemic and mistake-ridden air attack anyway so why not move forward instead of keeping it in neutral. That must have been what the Bears’ decision makers thought when they decided to put Mitch in.
We won’t talk about the Bears pass offense rankings. You can throw all that out now that Trubisky is in the lineup. The rookie will be facing the league’s 24th ranked pass defense so there will be some opportunities for them to pass the ball if they can get him going.
And if Mitch can throw the ball well hopefully his receivers will be there to not only catch it but hang onto it.
Mitch may want to rely on some of the team’s strongest pass catchers, their tight ends. Guys like Zach Miller and Dion Sims could help the rookie gain some comfort, and they could be a safety outlet when the heat is on. Trubisky needs to find a receiver he can rely upon and one of the tight ends would be a great outlet for him to throw the ball too.
When it comes to pass protection, the Vikings defense can get to the quarterback. They have 11 sacks in four games and their leader in sacks is Everson Griffen with five. Griffen will present many problems for the Bears’ offensive line. He will be going up against the likes of Charles Leno Jr., who, despite his critics, is one of the better offensive left tackles in the game.
Leno will have his work cut out for him on Monday night though.
The secondary for the Vikings has some great players in it. There is Bear “killer” safety Harrison Smith. Chicago fans know him all too well. He and two other teammates have one interception a piece this season so Trubisky better be wary of where Harrison and those guys are. If he finds them too often, it will be a long night.
The Vikings do play well against the run. Coming into the game, the Vikings are ranked third in the league allowing 71.2 yards per game. The Bears must run the ball to win and they could find it difficult Monday night. But having all of their offensive linemen healthy and ready to go will go a long ways to ensuring that they can run the ball. Chicago will see some success running the ball against the Vikings.
Remember last Halloween?
The Bears rushing offense is gaining an average of 117.5 yards per game which is 12th in the league. The Bears can win games on the ground so if they can run the ball well, they can win. But will the Vikings let them?
Minnesota’s best linebacker is Anthony Barr. Barr has recorded 26 total tackles this season and can make plays anywhere on the field. The Bears have to be wary of him. Taking care of Barr, who plays on the outside, will be the job of either Leno Jr., Massie or a tight end when the Bears run the ball.
Hopefully, those blockers will be able to take him out of the picture and free up some running room.
The will also need to worry about the Vikings leading tackler strong safety Andrew Sendejo. He can make plays in the secondary and will sneak up to play the run. Every blocker the Bears have available on Monday needs to be wary of those Sendejo and the aforementioned Smith. They can dominate any game.
Going back to the passing game, I don’t want to sound like a broken record but the Bears receiving corps is anemic. There is no star in that group and no one has stepped up to be their number one wide receiver. And with a rookie quarterback that makes his development even more difficult.
Aside from the tight ends and running, is there any other receiver who can step up?
The Bears have gotten some good play out of their defense and they can help Chicago win games if their offense can limit the mistakes.
The defense has been rocked by injuries as the linebacker and safety groups have seen starters go down. Of course, we all know that Jerrell Freeman is gone for the season and Nick Kwiatkoski is a few weeks away from coming back. Strong safety Quintin Demps will be out as also. And now outside linebacker Willie Young has been added to the injured reserve list.
Danny Trevathan will miss the game due to a suspension but even though the Bears’ defense is hurting they can still play and play well.
It’s not yet known who the Bears will face at quarterback for the Vikings. At last check, Sam Bradford was still a day to day decision. Case Keenum has been a good game manager and had a nice game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers but Chicago needs not to let him repeat that performance. They can prevent that with a solid performance from their pass rushing defense.
The Bears pass defense is ranked 15th against the pass allowing 220.8 yards per game. Minnesota’s passing offense is gaining an average of 263.2 yards per game which is 8th in the NFL. The Bears will have their work cut out for them. But not knowing who will play quarterback makes it a little hard to prepare.
The Vikings receivers are pretty good. Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs are two very capable wide receivers. Diggs already has four touchdowns this season and is difficult to cover.
The Bears must shut him down.
Chicago’s secondary has its slip-ups, but overall, they can be solid. They have some strong players at the cornerback spot and use a three-man rotation to help keep things fresh. Prince Amukamara, Kyle Fuller, and Marcus Cooper are the starters. Bryce Callahan comes in as a nickel back and has done well this season.
There is a lot of talent in this group.
But the pass rush is the key component for making sure the Vikings can’t pass the ball all over the field. Chicago’s defense currently has nine sacks this year. Their leaders there are Pernell McPhee and Willie Young with two apiece. When you compare that to the top team in the NFL in sacks (which is Jacksonville with 18) that’s not great at all.
The Bears must get pass pressure on whoever the quarterback is for Minnesota. And now that Willie Young is out for the year, rushing the passer will get tougher.
Chicago’s most capable pass rushers are Akiem Hicks, Leonard Floyd, and Pernell McPhee. They will go up against an offensive line that has allowed just five sacks all season.
Getting a sack on Monday night is going to be difficult for the Bears. But even if they can’t get sacks, they can hurry the quarterback and make him rush his throws. That could help generate turnovers which the Bears will desperately need to stay in this game.
Stopping the run hasn’t been difficult for Chicago. They’ve allowed just 85.5 yards through four games which is good for sixth in the NFL. The Vikings have rushed for 108 yards on average which is ranked 17th. Remember that their leading rusher, Cook, is out for the year. So, facing a new running back may either be good or bad for Chicago.
When it comes to points scored per game, Minnesota is ranked 19th scoring 19.8 per game. Chicago is allowing a whopping 26 points per game which is ranked 27th. The Bears need to turn that around and start holding opponents to fewer points.
Maybe they can start against the Vikings? If they want to win they must that and this is the game to start a new trend.
When it comes to special teams, the Bears have some trouble in the kicking game with Connor Barth. Their dissatisfaction with Barth showed this week as they brought in some other kickers to try out. However, as this article is being written, the Bears have not signed a new kicker.
Barth is two of four on field goals this year which is disappointing. Compare that to Vikings kicker Kai Forbath who has made all but one of his field goals this season (six of seven). The edge here goes to the Vikings. The problem is if the game comes down to a field goal kick the Bears may not be able to win the game or trust Barth to win it.
That’s unfortunate.
The Vikings leading kick return specialist is Jerick McKinnon and he has a 26.1-yard return average. Chicago’s kick return teams are allowing an average of 17.5 yards per return. They must not allow McKinnon or any other special teamer make a mockery of them on Monday night.
The team that plays the best on special teams may win the game as a mistake on special teams could help swing a close game in one team’s favor.
The Bears leading kick return specialist is Deonte Thompson with a 23.3-yard average. Minnesota’s special teams are allowing 22.6 yards per return the numbers are even. Maybe the Bears can get something going here.
Pat O’Donnell has been solid this season. His average is 48.6 but the most important thing is that he has dropped eight punts inside the 20. The Bears should be very comfortable with him punting the ball. Minnesota’s special teams units feature Marcus Sherels who is averaging a lowly 5.6 yards per return. The Bears’ punt coverage teams, which are allowing just 8.7 yards per return so they aren’t getting killed there.
The Vikings punter, Ryan Quigley, has a 42.7-yard average with seven placed inside the 20. The Bears punt return specialists are averaging 8.7 yards while Tarik Cohen leads the way with 7.8 yards per attempt. Chicago needs someone to break some long returns and either get good field position or get into the end zone.
That will help them win this or any game.
The coaching staffs for both teams are very experienced. When it comes down to the head coaches and what they have to offer, Fox may have an advantage over Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer in years being a head coach. However, Zimmer is a smart coach who makes good decisions.
They match up well with against one another.
Anytime these two teams get together; the outcome is difficult to predict. Last year, in their first game, no one expected the Bears to beat the Vikings. At that point, Minnesota was having a strong season while the Bears were struggling like they are now. But Chicago derailed the Vikings so anything is possible on any given day in any game between these two teams.
This being Mitchell Trubisky’s first start, it will be a tough outing for the Bears. But I hope I am wrong. Every Bears’ fan hopes that Trubisky will be able to play a strong first-ever game. Coupled with a strong rushing attack and opportunistic defense, maybe he can help the Bears win.
But they won’t win it. It will be close but they will fall just short. Trust me; there will be better days ahead for the Bears.
Score Prediction: Minnesota 24 Chicago 17

(Before It's News)
The Ravens fell to 2-2 today, losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers 26-9 at M&T Bank Stadium. RSR Staff react to the loss here…
Derek Arnold
I was fine burning last week’s tape. But to lose like this, at home, to your bitter rival? That’s just inexcusable. It was the Steelers’ first win in Baltimore since 2012, and the 17-point margin of victory was their highest here…ever. Yup, ever. Second-most is now 13 in 2002. Great job, guys!
What is this team doing? The injuries are a legitimate factor, especially against playoff-caliber opponents, but the injuries aren’t making Joe Flacco throw off his back foot, nor are they making passes bounce off guys’ hands, nor making the offensive scheme resemble something from the stone ages.
As for the defense, they obviously aren’t as good as they looked playing the likes of Andy Dalton and DeShone Kizer, but I’d like to see what they can do when the offense doesn’t force them to be on the field for 20+ of the first 30 minutes of every ballgame.
The Ravens once again look like a rudderless ship. Those Jaguars that they made look like world-beaters a week ago? Yeah, they just lost to the Jets.
Ryan Jones
There a lot of things about this Ravens team that make you shake your head this week. How was this team not ready to play at home after last week’s embarrassment? How does the play calling remain something that resembles a high school team? How has a coach not addressed Joe Flacco‘s predictable cadence which would help keep opposing defenses off balance?
I catch a lot of flack for my consistent criticism of John Harbaugh and I understand the injuries. But this team will continue to exist in a state of mediocrity as long as Harbaugh is on the Ravens sideline. Harbaugh can’t find an offensive coordinator who can consistently put points on the board and he’s let Dean Pees stick around far too long. Enough with the excuses, this team is on its way to missing the playoffs for the third straight year and the fourth time in the last five years. That would get a coach dismissed from any other team in the NFL. The standard shouldn’t be different for Harbaugh.
Joe Polek
Injuries are decimating this team. They can’t stop the run without Brandon Williams and they can’t keep Flacco off the ground without Marshal Yanda. Flacco looks awful and I sure hope it has something to do with his back and this is not just because he is terrible. It doesn’t help that Ozzie hasn’t done anything to give Flacco help on the offensive of side of the ball for years. The defense gave up a lot of points but I still believe the offense is the reason we lost this game, and the reason this team will not go to the playoffs.
We’ll have more knee-jerk reactions as they roll in…ugh.

Teoscar Hernandez was among the under-the-radar acquisitions at this year’s Trade Deadline, with the Blue Jays’ acquiring him from the Houston Astros. He’s long been a potential source of both power and speed, it was just a matter of getting the opportunity to show it in the Majors. Toronto is giving him that shot down the stretch, with an eye towards him playing a role in 2018, so let’s take a look and see how he’s looked thus far in September (prior to yesterday’s 2 HR explosion).
In 68 AB he’s hitting .265 with 5 HR, 14 RBI and 13 R (he’s also added 6 doubles, giving him a .574 SLG). With a believable .317 BABIP and 23.8% HR/FB, you would think that there would be nothing but positives. However he’s struggled with a 14.8% SwStr%, leading to a 31.5% strikeout rate. He hasn’t been particularly awful against any pitch, though he also hasn’t been very good (Whiff%):
Hard – 13.54%
Breaking – 18.89%
Offspeed – 20.00%
Hernandez had a 20.7% strikeout rate at Triple-A with the Astros prior to the trade (27.5% in 26 games for the Blue Jays’ Triple-A affiliate) and has had strikeout issues in the past (24.5% at Double-A in ’15). It had appeared like he had put them behind him, so we don’t want to push the panic button and need to give him time to adjust. It needs to be watched closely, but with a modest 31.5% O-Swing% there’s reason to believe.
He has yet to show off the speed in the Majors, but had 30+ SB in each of the previous three seasons. With the power he’s shown, we are looking like a potential 15/25 type option with the potential to hit .265-.270ish (assuming an improvement in his strikeout rate).
Hernandez is a player to watch over these final few days, especially since he has the potential to claim a starting role for next season and beyond.

I’m sure you’ve heard by now the astonishing allegations levied against Louisville today.
Louisville confirms it has received notice it is included in federal investigation involving criminal activity related to men’s basketball. — Jeff Goodman (@GoodmanESPN) September 26, 2017
Louisville received its punishment from the NCAA 6/11. A bball assistant was in a hotel room in Vegas w/Adidas conspiring to cheat on 7/27. — Mark Ennis (@MarkEnnis) September 26, 2017
That tweet from Mark Ennis, left me weirdly impressed. I mean that takes some guts. Seriously though this is a sad day for Louisville athletics and the Louisville fanbase. Following on the heels of their recent sex scandal, and now this.
Louisville is left with one move if they are serious about cleaning up their basketball program. Whether Rick Pitino knew or didn’t know of what was going, it doesn’t matter anymore.
And with that, Pitino and staff should be fired. https://t.co/KcxFNcWBYs — LouisvilleSportsLive (@LvilleSprtsLive) September 26, 2017
LouisvilleSportsLive is correct. Someone as to answer for the recent years of embarrassment of the Louisville basketball program. It has to start at the top, and that’s Rick Pitino. It is time to call it career on Rick Pitino.

",Erdogan says U.S. sacrificing strategic ally Turkey,"Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan looks on as he stands next to Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic (not pictured) during their visit to Novi Pazar, Serbia, October 11, 2017. REUTERS/Marko Djurica
ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan accused the United States on Thursday of mistreating a strategic ally, in a blistering speech which appeared to rule out swift resolution to a dispute between two NATO members jointly fighting Islamic State.
Hours after Ankara announced officials would meet soon to settle differences, Erdogan accused the U.S. consulate in Istanbul of hiding an individual with links to a network he blames for last year’s failed coup.
He also condemned U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria and separate U.S. court cases against a senior Turkish banker and the president’s own security guards, mocking what he said was Washington’s claim to be “the capital of democracy”.
Turkey’s relations with the United States and many Western countries have been strained since last year’s failed military coup against Erdogan, in which more than 240 people were killed.
Turkey felt many allies were slow to condemn the coup attempt and failed to appreciate the danger it faced. Western countries have grown alarmed at the scale of Turkey’s post-coup crackdown, with 50,000 people detained and 150,000 suspended from work.
Ties with the United States hit a low when Turkey detained a locally employed worker at the U.S. consulate in Istanbul last week.
The United States says it is still seeking an explanation for the arrest - the second detention of a consulate worker this year. It suspended most visa services in Turkey, saying it needed to review Turkey’s commitment to the security of its mission and staff. Turkey reciprocated within hours.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Wednesday and expressed his “profound concern”, the U.S. State Department said.
Erdogan has blamed outgoing U.S. ambassador John Bass, saying he was putting at risk a decades-old alliance.
“Let me be very clear, the person who caused this is the ambassador here. It is unacceptable for the United States to sacrifice a strategic partner to an ambassador who doesn’t know his place,” Erdogan told provincial governors meeting in Ankara.
TURKISH GRIEVANCES
Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said Turkish and U.S. officials would meet to work on resolving the crisis and described talks between their foreign ministers as constructive.
But Erdogan aired a list of grievances, accusing Washington of sheltering suspected members of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), and supporters of Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen he blames for last year’s coup attempt. Gulen denies involvement.
“On the one hand you say you are the capital of democracy, but you hide PKK and FETO members,” Erdogan said, using the label his government has given to Gulen’s network.
He said Washington was defending a “FETO-linked person hiding in your consulate”, and said a Christian pastor arrested in western Turkey last year was also “clearly linked” to Gulen.
Ambassador Bass said this week no one was hiding in the U.S. consulate, and that he had seen nothing of merit in the charges against the pastor, Andrew Brunson.
Erdogan said U.S. authorities had wrongly arrested the former head of Turkey’s majority state-owned Halkbank, and were trying to use a detained Turkish gold trader “as an informant”. Both men were arrested on charges of sanctions violations.
Referring to a U.S. grand jury indictment of 15 Turkish security officials who clashed with protesters during his visit to Washington in May, Erdogan said most of them had never set foot on U.S. soil. “You issue arrest warrants for 13 of my security staff who have never seen the United States,” he said.
“If the ambassador in Ankara is leading the grand United States, then shame on you,” Erdogan said. “Someone should have said: ‘You cannot treat your strategic partner this way, you can’t behave like this’.”",1

Fool me once, shame on you.
That’s the mantra going forward with this Seminoles squad. Going 0-2 to start the season is, I imagine, not what Seminole nation was anticipating. Heck, I imagine most of College Football wasn’t anticipating this. Despite 2017 being a circumstantial season for the Noles (to say the least), the loss against NC State was simply inexcusable. Despite breaking in a true freshman in QB James Blackman, QB play wasn’t the reason why FSU lost the game. The penalties against Florida State, despite what some fans may think, isn’t the reason why we lost the game. FSU’s defensive performance, the squad that was to be key to Seminole victory at least early on in the season, was perhaps the critical component as to why FSU lost this home opener. The fact that NC State came prepared and fired-up shouldn’t come as a surprise, but the lackluster motivation/urgency on Defense falls squarely on both the players as well as the coaching. Despite some rust, two weeks of preparation and no games in between should of been plenty to prepare against a veteran and hungry Wolfpack.
Ranting over, FSU is just one loss in the ACC. FSU has the talent to beat every team on their schedule. Yes, this includes a surging Clemson squad. But they have two strikes, one loss anticipated, the other not so. Coaching must improve to salvage the season. But it should come as no surprise that FSU can still make the ACC Championship game. Alabama doesn’t count against them in conference, and NC State has a tough slate ahead of them. A loss is entirely possible for the Pack in ACC play. That being said, FSU must play error-free in conference to do so.
At this time, I do not have faith in this squad to do so. Most analysts that I trust that follow Florida State have them, at best, a 8-3 squad (remember, the game against UL Monroe was cancelled, meaning this is an 11 game season). This likely means a loss to Clemson at Clemson, SC. I, personally, am leaning towards FSU being somewhere between a 7-4 and, on my worst of days, even a 6-5 squad.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, as an alumnus, I am proud to call myself a Seminole, and am proud of this team regardless. But there is no doubting: Jimbo has a staffing problem that needs rectifying FAST. The message is being lost on the players, and this’ll impact recruiting if Jimbo doesn’t jump ahead of this at the end of the season and make some maneuvers with his staff.
That all being said: FSU and Jimbo can prove us all wrong with a statement win against Wake Forest at Wake Forest.
Wake Forest: 4-0 on the season so far
Wins against Presbyterian (51-7), Boston College (34-10), Utah State (46-10), App State (20-19)
Strengths: QB play, Defensive Line, Dave Clawson Coaching
Weaknesses: Talent vs FSU
The Line: FSU -7.5
Comments: FSU needs a desperate win, and a big one, for me to make any reconsideration on the outlook of the season. I think Dave Clawson is going to have the Deacon’s prepared to defend their home turf against the struggling Seminoles. Fool me once, shame on you. I’m giving FSU one last chance here. I think the talent that FSU has on the field, despite the preparations made by Wake Forest, will be overwhelming for the Deacons. Those four wins came against teams that Wake Forest should of beat. FSU’s losses are, given circumstances, entirely understandable (although not quite excusable). A loss here would be catastrophic for FSU, both for the season and beyond. I don’t see it happening with so much on the line. Wake Forest plays FSU close, and might even lead early on, but I think FSU breaks away by the second half. I think FSU covers the spread 27-14. FSU better cover the spread for the nation to have reconsidered outlooks on the program in Conference, let alone in the national landscape. Wake Forest, in recent history, has played FSU close. I imagine it will be the same in this edition. If Wake Forest breaks the line (or forbid me to say it, beat FSU), you can bet that I’ll lean my outlook on the season towards the 6-5 range (and at risk for a bowl berth).

","While the Cubs Convey Success, the Nationals Still Flounder","In any case, Strasburg, who has always relied on a strict routine and was shut down before the 2012 playoffs because of a predetermined innings limit after he underwent Tommy John surgery, will not be available for Game 4.
“It’s fine,” Baker said. “We have full confidence in Tanner.”
And the Cubs have reason to believe in their starter: Jake Arrieta, a former Cy Young Award winner who skipped his last start of the regular season to rest a hamstring injury. Lately, Arrieta has been dominant: He has a 2.28 E.R.A. since the All-Star Game break.
“I’ve been able to throw a few really quality sides — timing is really good, the stuff is good,” Arrieta said. “So the arm strength hasn’t been affected, and if there’s any effect there, I think it’s in a positive way, just kind of giving it a breather, not throwing for a few days, and obviously the hamstring, benefited from that, as well. So I think it could have been a blessing in disguise for us.”
The way things have gone for the Cubs lately, that would only be fitting. Last year, Cleveland had home-field advantage for the World Series, but it ultimately helped the Cubs because Kyle Schwarber — a lumbering slugger coming back from a knee injury — had an extra game to be their designated hitter. The Cubs won three of the four games in Cleveland.

In left field on Monday, Schwarber dropped — and then kicked — a Daniel Murphy fly ball in the sixth inning to set up the Nationals’ first run. The Cubs simply shrugged it off; they had no hits at the time off Max Scherzer but went on to win, 2-1.
“There was no panic in the dugout,” said the Cubs’ Ben Zobrist. “There was no thought that it wasn’t going to happen. It was just: when is it going to happen? When you make mistakes, the mantra as a team is just, ‘So what?’ ”
The Cubs went 92-70 this season, an 11-game drop from last year, and five games worse than their record in 2015. But the playoffs reset everything, and the Cubs look well prepared.

No team has won consecutive World Series titles since the Yankees of 1998 through 2000, making this the longest stretch in major league history without a repeat champion. The Cubs’ president of baseball operations, Theo Epstein, said this spring that the biggest challenge for a defending champion is overcoming the physical toll on its pitchers from the previous postseason.

But like the Los Angeles Dodgers — who will face the winner of this series in the N.L.C.S. — the Cubs did not have a single starter among the top 20 in innings pitched this year. That could help their rotation handle the rigors of October better than most. The Cubs starter with the most innings — Jose Quintana, with 188⅔ — arrived from the White Sox in a trade for four prospects on July 13, more than two weeks before the non-waiver deadline.
“He was going to have a lot of suitors, did have a lot of suitors at that point,” said Cubs Manager Joe Maddon. “Our guys did a great job of jumping the gun there a little bit and getting him, because he’s been really exceptionally important to us.”
Quintana gave the Cubs a proven starter who did not have to grind through the last postseason and who is under team control through 2020. He went 7-3 with a 3.74 E.R.A. for the Cubs, then held Washington to an unearned run over five and two-thirds innings in Game 3.
Starters have a ghastly 8.53 E.R.A. in this postseason, but the Cubs’ trio of Kyle Hendricks, Jon Lester and Quintana has allowed one earned run in 18 2/3 innings for a 0.48 E.R.A. — and an average of more than six innings per start.
“If your starter can get you six, seven innings into a game, it takes a lot off your bullpen,” said Hendricks, adding later: “In this day and age, we’re lucky to have the rotation we have and rely on that.”
The Nationals boast a strong and durable rotation, too. But when the baseball gods dropped a gift in their laps on Tuesday, it squirted through their hands and shattered on the ground. The Cubs once played that hapless role, but not anymore. They expect the best in October — and play like it, too.",1

",Jets vs. Jaguars Week 4 Preview,"Jets vs. Jaguars Week 4 Preview
(Before It's News)
Coming off of what may have been the best performance Todd Bowles has gotten out of his team since taking over in a 20-6 win over the Miami Dolphins, the Jets host the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Jets may have a hard time dominating on defense the way they did against Jay Cutler and the Dolphins. Last week saw the Jaguars throttle the Baltimore Ravens 44-7 as quarterback Blake Bortles threw 4 touchdown passes in a game that he was forced to exit early.
Who: NY Jets (1-2) vs Jacksonville Jaguars (2-1)
When: Sunday at 1 pm
Where: Metlife Stadium
Point Spread: Jets +3
Here’s a look at which players and position groups will be key for the Jets this Sunday at home.
ILB Darron Lee vs. TE Mercedes Lewis:
Lewis is coming off of a 3 touchdown performance against the Baltimore Ravens and the Ravens have to know that Darron Lee has been vulnerable in coverage. Blake Bortles could view the match-up as an opportunity to stay with the hat hand in Lewis and look his way when the Ravens are in the red zone.
Jets D-line vs. RB Leonard Fournette:
Fournette is only averaging around 3.5 yards per carry, but the battering ram running back will test the Jets defensive line (and linebackers) early on. If they don’t find a way to keep him in check, the Jaguars will likely give the Jets a big dose of the heavy hitter. If the Jets defense gets gassed early, the Jags could also turn to former Jets RB Chris Ivory whose fresh legs and physical style could set him up for a big day as well.
Leonard Williams is still in search of his first sack of the season.
DL Leonard Williams vs. LT Cam Robinson:
The Jets like to move their defensive linemen around in multiple looks, and Williams, while nursing a sore wrist, is still looking for his first sack of the season. Robinson, a rookie out of Alabama, should give Williams, now in his third year, an opportunity to make some impact plays on defense.
WR Robby Anderson vs. CB AJ Bouye:
Bouye has been a big reason for Jacksonville’s improved defense and Robby Anderson was a key factor in the Jets offense getting going last week against the Dolphins. Anderson’s 69-yard touchdown pass was the team’s offensive highlight of the day. Look for quarterback Josh McCown to take a couple of deep shots down the field to Anderson, who has had success in beating some of the leagues best cornerbacks since last season.
RB’s Bilal Powell and Elijah McGuire vs MLB Paul Posluszny:
Matt Forte is on the shelf for this one with a bout of turf toe, so Jets fans will get their wish and see a heavy dose of Bilal Powell and rookie running back Elijah McGuire. Both Powell and McGuire do an excellent job of finding a hole if it’s there and finding their way through it. When they do, it will be Posluszny’s job to limit the damage at the second level.
RT Ben Ijalana/Brent Qvale vs. OLB Dante Fowler
Brandon Shell has been listed as doubtful in this one and that will likely mean Ijalana or Qvale will take his place. If so, Fowler will likely be moved around a fair bit and get his chance to make some plays against a pair of tackles who are adequate at best. Josh McCown has been solid for Gang Green in the early going, and Jacksonville would like nothing more than to disrupt his timing with some heavy blitz packages.
The Jets will be hoping for a better turnout than they saw last week, but in all reality it’s going to take more than a win or two to convince the fan base that this team is worth making the trek for and Sunday’s game probably won’t help.
Prediction:
Jaguars 27 Jets 17

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-technology/how-a-homemade-tool-helped-north-koreas-missile-program-idUSKBN1CH1I4
",How a homemade tool helped North Korea's missile program,"SEOUL, (Reuters) - In 2009, a pop video from North Korea celebrated a new national hero - one that outside experts would later realize was at the heart of the secretive state’s banned nuclear and missile programs.
That hero, widely available in factories across the world, was the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine.
Big, grey and boxy, CNC machines use pre-programmed guides to produce intricate parts for everything from automobiles and mobile phones to furniture and clothes. They offer accuracy that human machine tool operators are unable to achieve.
In North Korea, thanks to a combination of homemade technology and reverse engineering, the machines now play a critical role in the weapons programs. They allow Kim Jong Un to build nuclear bombs and missiles without relying as heavily on outside technical aid or imports.
Nuclear weapons experts say this has helped him accelerate missile and nuclear testing despite international sanctions on the transfer of sensitive equipment.
Special Section: North Korea revealed.
Interactive: Nuclear North Korea
Interactive: Kim’s latest act of defiance
“North Korea’s centrifuges and new missiles all depend on components made with CNC machine tools,” said Jeffrey Lewis, head of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of Strategic Studies at Monterey, California.
“(They) are the essential underlying technology for producing missiles and nuclear weapons,” said Lewis.
Since 1996, CNC machines have been included in the Wassenaar Arrangement – an international arms control regime aimed at stopping the proliferation of equipment with both civilian and military uses. North Korea is not a signatory.
The country’s celebrations of its CNC technology have been fulsome. Hundreds of dancers in luminous orange and green performed the CNC pop song, titled “Break through the cutting edge,” at a Korean Workers’ Party celebration in 2010. In 2012, the year the South Korean hit “Gangnam Style” was released, the North’s CNC title was on karaoke machines nationwide, according to Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based company that trains North Koreans in business skills. The official video for the song opens with a long-range North Korean rocket soaring into a blue sky.
CUTTING EDGE
North Korea likely started to develop its own CNC machines in the early 1990s as part of a drive to build sophisticated missiles and nuclear weapons, nuclear experts say. It probably learned how to make them by taking apart machines it had imported from the Soviet Union.
North Koreans perform during mass games in Pyongyang, August 2011. Choson Exchange/via REUTERS
Its first homemade CNC machine was introduced in 1995. Former leader Kim Jong Il gave the machine the “Ryonha” brand, according to a 2009 article in the country’s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. That was the first time state media mentioned the technology.
By 2009, the machines had become a mainstay of North Korean propaganda, as Pyongyang launched a nationwide campaign to boost domestic industry. Sanctions were mounting after its second nuclear test and a long-range missile launch that year.
At the time, arms control experts raised concerns about a visit by former leader Kim Jong Il to a North Korean factory where homemade CNC machines appeared to be producing aluminum tubes. These could be used for nuclear centrifuges.
“By around 2010, it seemed they were capable of manufacturing various types of CNC machines,” said Kim Heung-gwang, a North Korean defector who taught at Pyongyang’s Hamhung Computer Technology University before defecting to South Korea.
But it wasn’t until 2013 that the Korea Ryonha Machinery Joint Venture Corporation, which produced the machines, was blacklisted by the U.N. Security Council for supporting the weapons programs.
Slideshow (3 Images)
And it was only in August this year that U.S. intelligence officials told Reuters North Korea likely has the ability to produce its own missile engines themselves. (Full Story)
Now, Kim Heung-gwang estimates, North Korea has about 15,000 CNC machines. He bases this on North Korean state media reports and photos as well as interviews with more than a dozen defectors who were scientists, professors or factory workers.
MASS PRODUCTION
Pyongyang hailed the homemade machines as a triumph for its governing ideology of “Juche”, which champions self-sufficiency. But that wasn’t strictly true.
In August 2016, state media released photos of Kim Jong Un visiting a factory using CNC machines with the logo of Swiss engineering firm ABB ABB.UL, one of the leading players in the global CNC machine market. It’s not clear when or how the machine reached North Korea.
ABB said the firm respects all applicable trade sanctions against North Korea, and undertakes not to deliver ABB equipment to the country. “That said, we cannot rule out that some of our equipment may have been resold to DPR of Korea without our knowledge or permission,” the company said in response to a Reuters inquiry, using North Korea’s official title.
A United Nations panel monitoring sanctions on North Korea said in a report this year that Tengzhou Keyongda CNC Machine Tools Co of China had been a supplier of Pyongyang’s new CNC machines. A sales representative for Tengzhou Keyongda told Reuters the company stopped selling CNC machines to North Korea four years ago, and no longer maintains trade relations with the country.
Despite sanctions, CNC machines are commonplace across North Korean manufacturing and can be brought in through China and Russia, said Lee Choon-geun, a senior fellow at the Science and Technology Policy Institute in South Korea.
The biggest loophole has been that while some CNC machines are banned because they can have both military and civilian functions, most serve civilian industry. “Given their dual-use capability, you could even import the machines for other purposes, take them to pieces and use them however you want,” said Lee.
The CNC song highlights this in its opening line: “Whatever it is, once we put our mind to it, there’s a program to make it,” it says.",1

U.S. President Trump called for a border wall to be included in any DACA immigration deal, executive Harvey Weinstein has been fired from the Weinstein Co following reports of sexual harassment allegations and Kim Jong Un promoted his sister to the opaque, all-powerful party organ where top state affairs are decided.
DACA
President Donald Trump, who pledged to help protect young people known as “Dreamers” brought illegally to the United States as children, called for money to fund a border wall to be part of any immigration deal. In a list of “principles” laid out in documents released by the White House, the Trump administration also pressed for a crackdown on unaccompanied minors who enter the United States, many of them from Central America.
The plan, which was delivered to leaders in Congress on Sunday night, drew a swift rebuke from Democrats, who are seeking a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that Trump ended last month.

The promotion of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s 28-year-old sister to the country’s top decision-making body is a sign he is strengthening his position by drawing his most important people closer to the center of power, experts and officials say.

",Iceland Becomes Smallest Nation to Qualify for World Cup,"Ireland secured a playoff spot from Group D, while Wales was eliminated only 15 months after reaching the semifinals at Euro 2016.
Spain and Italy won their last qualifying games in Group G, which had already been won by the Spaniards. Italy was already assured of a playoff spot.
Here is a look at all the European qualifying action from Monday:
GROUP D
Serbia qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 2010 by beating Georgia, 1-0, in Belgrade with a goal by Aleksandar Prijovic in the 74th minute.
The result left Wales and Ireland to decide their fate in a showdown in Cardiff, and the Irish got the victory and a playoff berth behind James McClean’s 57th-minute goal.
“That last half-hour seemed an eternity,” Ireland Manager Martin O’Neill said. “We had to withstand pressure but we knew at some stage we would have to try to win the game and we did it.”
Bale could not play for Wales because of injury.
Serbia finished with 2 more points than Ireland, and 4 more than Wales.
The Irish will try to qualify for the World Cup for a fourth time — and first since 2002. They will not be seeded in the playoffs draw, which will take place on Tuesday.

GROUP G
Spain ended its qualifying campaign by beating Israel, 1-0, in Jerusalem, while Italy scraped past Albania by 1-0 in Shkoder via another poor effort, one that will do little to inspire confidence in Coach Gian Piero Ventura and his team.

“We have some limitations at the moment but today there was the desire to try and do things,” Ventura said.
With a World Cup berth already secured, Spain played without most of its regular starters in Jerusalem but won thanks to a long-range strike by Asier Illarramendi in the second half
It finished unbeaten, with nine wins and one draw, against Italy in Turin last year. The Italians ended 5 points behind Spain.
Macedonia beat Liechtenstein, 4-0, in a match between the two bottom teams in the group.
Liechtenstein was outscored by 39-1 in its 10 qualifiers.
GROUP I
Iceland made history with a win over last-place Kosovo. Gylfi Sigurdsson scored in the first half and Johann Gudmundsson added another in the second, keeping Iceland’s momentum from its inspiring run at Euro 2016.
Iceland, unbeaten in 13 competitive home games, will be the smallest nation in terms of population to play in soccer’s showcase event.
The result left Iceland 2 points ahead of Croatia, which beat Ukraine by 2-0 in Kiev to secure the playoff spot.
Ukraine finished 3 points behind Croatia, in third place.
It was the tightest group in European qualifying. Iceland entered the final round with a 2-point lead over both Croatia and Ukraine.
Kosovo completed its maiden qualifying campaign for a major tournament with a single point, from a draw at Finland.",1
http://www.disclose.tv/news/nasafunded_experiment_led_to_intercourse_between_a_woman_and_a_dolphin/140434,NASA-Funded Experiment Led To Intercourse Between A Woman And A Dolphin,"Carl Sagan went to the St. Thomas Dolphin Point laboratory in 1964 but little did he know at that time just how controversial the setting would eventually become.
 
Sagan was a member of a group with the name of The Order of the Dolphin and this was a secretive group. The name does not suggest it but in fact, the group was focused on looking for extra-terrestrial intelligence.
 
Another man in the group was Dr. John Lilly and he had written a book with the title of Man and Dolphin which had the theory that dolphins wanted to communicate with human beings. His writing set an experiment off that did not quite go as planned.
 
NASA Helped With Funding For Communication Between Humans And Dolphins

Frank Drake, an astronomer at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory Green Bank Telescope was behind the Project Ozma. He was looking for alien life through radio waves that were being emitted from other planets. When he read the book wrote by Lilly he reached some parallels between his own work and that of Lilly’s. He helped to get funding from NASA along with other government agencies to realize his vision, a bridge of communication between dolphins and human beings.
 
He built a laboratory with workspace on the upper level along with an enclosure for dolphins on the bottom in the Caribbean and called it Dolphin Point. Margaret Howe Lovatt, aged 23, visited the lab and she was hoping to witness a breakthrough and see the stories she had heard about dolphins being able to communicate with humans.
 
She met with Gregory Bateson at the lab and was allowed to watch the dolphins and take notes while she watched them. Even though she did not have any training she was intuitive and was offered an open invitation and began to work with the dolphins. She helped them to create sounds that were human-esque but the whole process was tedious. She convinced Lilly to allow her to live in the lab and waterproofed the rooms in the upper part of the building and filled them with a few feet of water so that dolphins and humans could share the same space.
 
Male Dolphin Develops Sexual Urges For Trainer
 
Peter the dolphin was chosen for an immersive language experiment and Lovatt found that he was interested in anatomy. He would look at the backs of her knees for a long time and wondered how the legs worked. However, Peter then started to have urges and would rub himself on her knee, foot or hand and she had to force the dolphin back down into the water many times. She said that eventually, she decided to satisfy the dolphin’s sexual urges as it was easier to incorporate them and allow them to happen. She insisted that there was nothing sexual on her part, however, they did bond even closer. Drake became disappointed when he found out that the experiment was not going quite as planned with the dolphin language and could have been the beginning of the end for the funding. However, while the project was waning the attachment between Peter and Lovatt grew.
 
The live-in experience with the dolphins came to an end and it was not long before Peter the dolphin died, by suicide it seems. Apparently, dolphins require conscious effort to breathe and Peter just took a breath and sank to the bottom of his pool and never came up. It was said that he was heartbroken and could not understand why they had been separated.

",NFL: 'Taking the knee' anthem protest to be discussed with clubs,"NFL teams have been ""taking the knee"" during the American national anthem as a form of protest
The NFL will discuss the issue of players kneeling during the United States national anthem when it meets in New York next week.
Kneeling at NFL games has become a form of protest against racial injustice.
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell says disputes over the protests threaten ""to erode the game's unifying power"" and called on clubs to resolve the issue.
Goodell said the anthem controversy was a ""barrier to honest conversations and making real progress"".
In a letter sent to NFL teams, he added: ""Like many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the national anthem. It is an important moment in our game.
""We want to honour our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.
""We also care deeply about our players and respect their opinions and concerns about critical social issues.""
Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the protest last year when he sat down as the Star-Spangled Banner was played during a pre-season game in 2016.
He explained his gesture, which later became known as ""taking the knee"", was meant to highlight racial injustice and police brutality against African Americans.
Roger Goodell has been the NFL commissioner since 2006
However, President Donald Trump has criticised players for the protests and pressed the NFL to ban them.
Goodell said the NFL had heard from players at its September meeting about why the issues were so important to them and how the NFL could support them.
In the letter, he added: ""Everyone involved in the game needs to come together on a path forward to continue to be a force for good within our communities, protect the game and preserve our relationship with fans throughout the country.
""The NFL is at its best when we ourselves are unified. In that spirit, let's resolve that next week we will meet this challenge in a unified and positive way.""",1

","Hassan al-Thawadi on Worker Welfare, Qatari Goals and the 2022 World Cup","Absolutely. If you look for parallels, look at South Africa during 2010 — you experienced that first African World Cup, you feel that buzz. You land in Joburg or Cape Town and walk the streets and you feel that electricity. It’s the same thing over here: it’s the first World Cup in the Middle East. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and we’ve always focused on it being a regional World Cup. This is a World Cup beyond Qatar. It’s a cultural experience.
Does the current situation in the region, the blockade of Qatar by some of its neighbors, complicate that idea of making it a regional event?
No. We’ve always taken the simple position that sports is elevated from conflict. This is always a platform to bring people together, and to separate it from any political ideology.
Do you think your neighbors will play along with that?
I can’t speak on their behalf. From our side, we’ve always taken that position. Even today, from our side, everybody’s welcome. I hope that they see reason, and recognize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the people of our region. We’re football crazy. I mean, the Middle East, the Arab world, is football crazy, plain and simple. You go to any corner, whether it’s in Qatar, whether it’s in Saudi, whether it’s in Morocco, and start speaking football, and you will find a very, very deep caldron of passion and knowledge.

The compact nature of Qatar’s World Cup means the stadiums will be only an hour or two apart at most, and sometimes much less. Are there plans to take advantage of that, and does that raise security issues?
The compact World Cup has a lot of advantages, first and foremost for the fans. Whoever has experience previous World Cups, you always had to figure out ways of traveling, and accommodations, trying to follow your team, and it puts stress on fans. Here, the fans have the opportunity to attend more than one match a day.
There is talk about taking advantage of that, right? Of selling multiday or multigame passes?
That’s what I’m saying. You can watch a match in the afternoon and then go for the evening match as well. So it adds that element for fans who want to do that. And more importantly, for players. Because the players don’t have to worry about traveling from one place to another. They don’t have to worry about playing a match in a certain city, getting up early, getting on a flight, moving on, getting used to a new accommodation, resting, and then going out and playing. Everybody is focused on what matters: delivering to the best of their ability on the pitch. And that can only be good for the fans.

And security concerns from having all those different fans so close to one another?
You look at the Olympics, it has that Olympic Village feel, that global, international, we-are-a-global-community feel to it. And that’s what this World Cup offers as well. In terms of managing that, and security, we are in constant coordination and cooperation with major security operations throughout the world, learning from them, whether it’s in terms of Champions League matches or league matches. We’re present at every single major tournament.
But mixing rival fans can lead to trouble, like the day when English and Russian fans fought in Marseille at the European Championships last year.
I think it’d be very cynical and very pessimistic to look at certain examples and say, “This is the norm,” when sometimes they’re the outlier.
Have you had feedback from FIFA, or from individual associations, about the idea that a team might be able to spend the whole tournament in one place?
That was the essence of our bid, and for a lot of people it was appealing. What matters for us is to create an environment for the teams and the coaches. But I think it’s important to note that major international teams have come to Qatar to use it as the base for their winter camps — Barcelona, Real Madrid, Milan, Bayern Munich. And people come because we have got some of the best facilities in the world. State of the art. And that’s the reason they continue to come back.

No country is perfect. We have issues, and we have challenges when it comes to being the fastest growing nation at a point in time in terms of both population and economic activity. Unfortunately, while the laws were in place, the ability and the resources to implement and enforce these laws were challenging. With the World Cup coming on board, of course the spotlight came in, but this is something we recognized. So when we said legacy, we mean the World Cup is an opportunity to be a catalyst for positive change, and to increase the momentum for initiatives that the government was already committed to. And of course worker welfare is one of them.
There’s obviously what the government has done, which I can’t speak to with authority. What I can tell you is what we’ve done as the Supreme Committee. When we won the World Cup, we developed a charter, we assessed the market conditions, we looked at the gaps and the issues, we consulted with NGOs and the construction sector, to understand the challenges from their side, and we developed a set of standards.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
We are now in our second edition, and these standards are a live document, and they are constantly being reviewed. To ensure they’re being enforced, we’ve developed a four-tier auditing system: a self-audit by the contractors themselves; our own audits that we do; we’ve got a third-party auditor that conducts its own and issues its own annual report; and we’ve of course got the government auditing our projects as well.
These issues that you’re referring to in the news media weren’t reflected on us, weren’t the World Cup project. There is only one report that came out, from Amnesty International, where they had performed an investigation, and then a year later they came to us and said: “These are our findings. What do you have to say about this?” During that year — we didn’t realize Amnesty International had performed that investigation — we identified these issues and were fixing them. So actually our system worked. Because as the projects started ramping up, we started identifying the areas and the gaps and so on, and we had addressed a lot of these issues.
So if we called Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, they would say everything’s been fixed?
They wouldn’t say everything’s been fixed because I’m not saying everything’s been fixed. What I’m saying is this is a work in progress. This is not something that can be fixed overnight. But you can definitely talk to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch and talk about our commitment, talk about our transparency with them, about the progress that we’ve made. And I would urge you to call them and ask them that question. On the other hand, when you call them, ask them if all the conditions in the United States were fixed. Then I’d be interested in you making a comparison on the answer.
Because for me it’s very simple: the issue that we’re talking about, of worker welfare, is an issue that the global community faces. Every country in the world faces it.
There are ways that a major international event like this might seem to clash with the culture of a Muslim country, so let me ask a couple specific questions. Will drinking alcohol be allowed in the stadiums and the hotels and the fan zones?
We’ve always said it very clearly: alcohol will be allowed. But it won’t be allowed in public spaces. It’ll be allowed in certain designated areas, for example, but you won’t be allowed to walk the street drinking alcohol.
Will gay fans be welcomed, and do they have anything to fear?
It’s a simple thing: everyone is welcome to come to Qatar. What we ask is that when people come just to respect — we’re a relatively conservative nation. Public display of affection is something that’s not part of our culture. So all we ask is that every fan who comes in, and every fan is welcome, is we ask that people respect that.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The last one is: should Israel qualify, would the team and its fans be welcome?
Everyone is welcome. It’s a simple answer: everybody is welcome.
How many visitors do you expect in 2022?
Cumulatively, we’re talking about 1.2 million.
Can Qatar handle that yet? How much of the infrastructure for that is in place already?
It’s being developed. But this is the vision of the World Cup for us. When we first bid, the idea was simple: Utilizing this World Cup as an opportunity as a catalyst for the country’s growth, for its original urban development plans. So as the country was expanding, the infrastructure of the World Cup fit in with the country’s plans. We re-prioritized certain projects, obviously, to fulfill the World Cup requirements, but that’s just a milestone in the country’s overall development. So the hotels required for the country’s tourism requirements are being developed. The metro system is going to be functioning by 2020. The road networks are being developed as well. So by 2020, 2021, everything is going to be in place.
Photo
How do you avoid the kind of waste that Brazil and South Africa experienced, these massive stadiums they don’t need after the tournament leaves?
When we submitted the bid, that was the first thing in our mind: we wanted to avoid white elephants, a reminder of money that was spent and then not utilized.
So take the stadiums: each stadium we’ve designed, we assured that it was on the transit network that was being developed for the country, and that each one had to be a center for the community, that each one had a legacy story already developed.
We realized the FIFA requirements in terms of capacity didn’t fulfill our needs beyond 2022, so we developed the modular seating concept. We decided on the stadiums we would need, and these would have a mixture of fixed and modular seats. So the fixed seats would be the capacity we need – about 15,000 to 20,000 — and the rest would be taken out. Other stadiums, the entire concept is modular, so we’ll be taking the entire seating capacity out.
How did we decide which would be temporary? We engaged the community. For every design, we went to them and asked, “What do you need? What are you missing? How can this facility assist you?” So, for example, down south is a small little city called Al Wakrah. We went to the community and asked them, “What do you need?” They turned around and said one of the things we need is wedding halls. “There’s a lot of these weddings, and we always go up to Doha — we need a wedding hall.” So within the project we developed an area for the wedding hall. There was a need for school facilities, so within the master plan we also have developed space for school facilities. Every single stadium has that kind of story, to be used as a center for its community.
But that’s stadiums. In terms of infrastructure, the metro system, the road network, it’s part of the urban development of the country.",1

“There’s several months to go and obviously it will be up to her as to where she is with her fitness.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s government sought on Tuesday to contain the fallout from the disclosure by the nation’s third-biggest steel maker, Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T), that it had fabricated data on components used in cars, aircraft and space rockets, sending shock waves through the Japanese manufacturing sector.
Faced with the latest in a series of missteps that have undermined Japan’s reputation for high-quality production, the industry ministry instructed Kobe Steel to assess the safety impact from the scandal.
The company said products used by about 200 companies were certified with falsified data. They included Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Central Japan Railway (9022.T), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T), Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T) and Subaru Corp (7270.T), the companies confirmed.
Analysts say the announcement further tarnishes the reputation of Japan’s globe-trotting manufacturers, long celebrated for their high-quality products. It could also undermine confidence in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s moves to improve corporate governance as part of his program of Abenomics.
The admission from the steel and aluminium maker follows scandals involving falsified data at household names such as Nissan Motor (7201.T), Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) and Takata Corp., which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.
Toshiba Corp (6502.T) is still battling the fallout of a scandal involving reporting inflated profits.
“Looking back over several years, foreign investors have bought Japanese stocks on expectations for Abenomics, but among the ”three arrows,“ the growth strategy isn’t functioning,” said, Makoto Kikuchi, CEO of Myojo Asset Management.
“While they say they’re strengthening corporate governance, improprieties focused on manufacturing have been popping up. Going forward, this will be a body blow to Japanese shares.”
Toyota called the revelations a “grave issue,” and said it was making checks on where the components were used and what effect they have on products using them.

IMPACT ON KOBE CUSTOMERS UNCLEAR
In a statement on Sunday Kobe Steel said some aluminium and copper products shipped from September 2016 to August 2017 were falsely labeled.
Kobe Steel said the misconduct involved dozens of staff and possibly stretched back 10 years. It apologized and said it had appointed lawyers to investigate.

Aluminium castings, forgings and flat-rolled items, along with copper strips and tubes were among the products affected, the company said in a statement.
“These are improper actions that could shake the foundation of fair trade,” Yasuji Komiyama, director of the industry ministry’s metal industries division, told reporters at a briefing on the revelations.
“We want Kobe Steel to make the utmost effort to restore trust from society”, he said.
A Kobe spokesman told Reuters the firm is working with customers to check for any issues. “To our knowledge it has not affected any customer’s products at this stage,” he said.
Boeing (BA.N) said in a statement it was working “with our suppliers since being notified of the issue.”

“Nothing in our review to date leads us to conclude that this issue presents a safety concern,” it said. Kawasaki Heavy Industries (7012.T) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) supply parts to Boeing including for its 777 Dreamliner.
MHI said Kobe Steel products were used on its Mitsubishi Regional Jet and rockets, including a H-2A rocket launched on Tuesday to put a navigation satellite into orbit. There were no technical problems with the components, MHI said.
Industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defense equipment made by Kawasaki Heavy, MHI, IHI Corp (7013.T) and Subaru and checks were being made for any safety issues.
EARNINGS FALLOUT?
Kobe Steel has said the impact of the data falsification on its earnings is still unknown.
“The impact on financials is unclear, but could be substantial depending on request(s) for replacement/recall,” Jefferies analyst Thanh Ha Pham said in a note. “Handling the situation is key to avoid long-term reputation damage.”
The steelmaker has reported losses in the last two full financial years but is expecting to return to profit in the current period.
Sales of Kobe Steel’s aluminium and copper division fell 6.4 percent year on year to 323.3 billion yen ($2.87 billion) in the financial year ending March 2017, with recurring profit falling 20.5 percent to 12 billion yen.
The company, based in Kobe in western Japan, has been expanding its aluminium business as carmakers increasingly use the material, which is lighter than steel, to meet tighter environmental rules.",1

","Soccer: From ridiculous to sublime, Tite turns Brazil around","FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - World Cup 2018 Qualifiers - news conference - Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) headquarters, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, September 15, 2017.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Little more than a year has gone by since Tite took over as coach of a Brazil side still reeling from embarrassing exits in the World Cup and Copa America but in that short time he has transformed the team into favorites for Russia 2018.
No one could have imagined just how influential the former Corinthians coach would be but nine wins in 10 World Cup qualifiers are just reward for a return to the form that won them a record five World Cup titles.
“There is no questioning the enormous quality of Brazil’s players, Tite and backroom staff,” the normally cautious former World Cup winner Tostao wrote before the final two qualifiers against Bolivia and Chile. “The team is ready.”
Tite retained several players who had misfired under Luiz Felipe Scolari during the 2014 World Cup and his successor Dunga but he transformed their front line with the introduction of attack-minded youngsters Philippe Coutinho and Gabriel Jesus.
In midfield he recalled Paulinho and Renato Augusto, his former charges at Corinthians.
With Real Madrid’s Casemiro an automatic choice to anchor the team and Neymar still the undisputed talisman, the side is settled and there are no major disagreements over the first 11 for the first time in years.
Tite’s task between now and next June is mostly deciding who will support those leading men.
The problem, if there is one, comes with Brazil’s almost customary over-confidence. They are the only side to play in every World Cup and even after their 7-1 hammering by Germany in the 2014 semi-finals on home soil, they believe they are special.
Just as in 2006, when Brazil sailed through the qualifiers with players like Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Ronaldinho and Adriano, they go to Russia as one of the clear favorites.
But Brazil were knocked out at the quarter-final stage by France and over confidence was one of the reasons cited.
Tite is a master of playing down expectations and - crucially in a nation that famously has 200 million coaches – he commands the respect of both players and press.
That has given him an authority that few Brazil managers this century have enjoyed and he has used it to warn their outstanding form is no guarantee of success.
“We are at a stage of strengthening, consolidating and growing,” he said when announcing his squad for this week’s games.
“We’re not in the comfort zone stage but rather a confidence zone stage.”

",Blackhawks at Detroit - 4-2 Win Recap,"Blackhawks at Detroit – 4-2 Win Recap
(Before It's News)
“First Game at Little Caesars Arena”
As we inch closer to the regular season, we saw a nice win for the Blackhawks in the preseason. In their second to last game of the preseason, we saw them play a young Detroit team missing many of their big-name players. The Blackhawks were also missing key players like Kane, Saad, Seabrook, Keith, and Crawford. In their first appearance at Little Caesars Arena the Red Wings new facility, the ‘Hawks won 4-2.
The first period started a little slow and with some sloppy plays, but things would start to get better pretty quick. At 4:54 we saw the first of 10 penalties in the game when Red Wing Robbie Russo slashed Gustav Forsling. The power play was just ok early on but got better in the later periods of the game. Shortly after at 8:23 we would see the first of the Blackhawks penalty kill unit because of a Laurent Dauphin tripping penalty. On the PP, the Red Wings had what looked like a sure goal when Ben Street shot at a sprawling Anton Forsberg. With a wide-open net, the shot went high and hit the crossbar. Later, The Blackhawks would go on the penalty kill 2 more times after a David Kampf interference call and a Tomas Jurco slashing call.
The second period started with the Red Wings on the power play, where they scored the first goal of the game. Justin Abdelkader had the puck down down low, and passed to Niklas Kronwall at the blue line. Kronwall would let a shot go that Red Wings rookie Michael Rasmussen nicely redirected past Anton Forsberg. The period went on seeing a couple good shifts from the makeshift second line of Artem Anisimov, John Hayden, and Vinnie Hinostroza. We saw Anisimov put the puck through a defenders legs to a stuff attempt, and John Hayden have a good shot attempt which resulted in Artem Anisimov getting robbed on the rebound, with a wide-open net. No scoring would come till late in the period.
At 13:50 Richard Panik got the Blackhawks on the board and tied the game. Alex DeBrincat held the puck at the line and tapped it to an open Jonathan Toews, who would make a great cross-ice pass to a wide open Richard Panik. Panik sent a one-timer past Petr Mrazek. The Wings would take the lead back about two minutes later when Libor Sulak put a shot past a sliding Connor Murphy to the glove side of Forsberg.
The third period is where the Blackhawks hit their stride. At the 1:41 mark of the third period, Tanner Kero chipped a pass to a streaking Vince Hinostroza, who weaved through two defenders. Hinostroza then sent a slick backhand pass to Tommy Wingels on the back door, who put a well placed one-timer past Petr Mrazek. Next, the highly anticipated Alex DeBrincat would score his second preseason goal on the power play, as the Wings’ Sulak was given a two-minute minor for hooking against Laurent Dauphin. After taking a pass from Gustav Forsling, DeBrincat then made a nice backhanded pass to defenseman Cody Franson. Franson looked to pass the puck to Jonathan Toews but the pass went all the way through the crease to back to DeBrincat, who let go a nice wrist shot over Mrazek. The Red Wings would challenge the goal for offsides but failed resulting in the ‘Hawks going on another power play. For those unaware, new this year, a failed off-sides challenge results in a two-minute minor for delay of game, instead of just losing a time-out. The final goal of the game would come at 18:35 when Laurent Dauphin made a nice steal at center ice and backhand the puck into the empty net.
The Good
Alex DeBrincat- The kid is looking more confident with the puck and is usually in the right position at the right time. While still getting pushed around a bit, it seems DeBrincat is learning how to win his battles. Two points on the night
Artem Anisimov – While not finding the score sheet Anisimov proved his worth with a few good shot attempts and his line created some good chances.
The Penalty Kill – The ‘Hawks would go five for six on the PK. They seem more aggressive and have better cycling better than we saw last season, so far.
John Hayden – Hayden very well may play himself into a roster spot. While not scoring in this game, he would end up with three hits and 2 shots on net. The more Hayden plays, the more he shows his skill, speed, and physicality. He also seems to cause a little disruption when he is on the ice, almost starting another fight in front of the goal.
Vinnie Hinostroza – While I don’t know if he will make the opening night roster, watching Vinnie was fun tonight. As we know Hinostroza is fast, he is really starting to show the offensive upside. He is starting to make more smart plays and is also seeing the plays much better.
Anton Forsberg – Forsberg would have another good night in goal, saving 32 of 34 shots. As of now expect Forsberg to be the backup. The Bad Power Play – Not horrible but the ‘Hawks went one for four on the power play. Seeing a couple more shots and some more zone time would be nice, but they were also missing some major pieces on the power play. The Ugly Tomas Jurco – Yet again another game where he was invisible. Other than occasionally touching the puck Jurco had zero shots on goal, one hit, and a giveaway. Can we please get rid of this failed experiment.

",League invites NFLPA to join anthem discussion,"NFL Football - Miami Dolphins vs New Orleans Saints - NFL International Series - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - October 1, 2017 New Orleans Saints players kneel before the U.S. national anthem before the match Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs
(Reuters) - NFL Players Association Executive Director DeMaurice Smith will attend meetings next week where team owners will discuss the issue of player protests during the U.S. national anthem, the two sides said on Wednesday.
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell invited Smith to the Oct. 17-18 meetings in New York, where the issue of some players kneeling in protest when the anthem is played before each game is expected to command much attention.
”There has been no change in the current policy regarding the anthem,“ the two sides said in a statement. ”The agenda will be a continuation of how to make progress on the important social issues that players have vocalized.
“Everyone who is part of our NFL community has a tremendous respect for our country, our flag, our anthem and our military, and we are coming together to deal with these issues in a civil and constructive way.”
The protests, in a league where African-Americans make up the majority of players, have continued through the season, with some players kneeling and others standing arm-in-arm in solidarity.
The gesture is intended to call attention to what protesting players see as a pattern of racism in the treatment of African-Americans by U.S. police.
The issue has been exacerbated after U.S. President Donald Trump said last month that players who did not stand during the anthem should be fired, prompting many NFL players to kneel and lock arms in solidarity.
The NFL requires players to stand for the anthem and face the American flag, but no player has been disciplined for a protest.
League spokesman Joe Lockhart, speaking during a conference call on Tuesday, said the issue had overshadowed the season and owners would discuss it in the hopes of getting “back to football”.",1

The Las Vegas false flag mass shooting
 
that occurred on the night of October 1st, 2017, is without doubt another false flag operation. The clues are everywhere, the official narrative is full of holes and the event fits the pattern of the false flag formula we have to come to know. We have another patsy who is a highly unlikely precision killer, we have evidence of multiple shooters, we have foreknowledge and we have no semblance of a motive. We live in such a twisted world that now, when events like these happen in the US, in an attempt to get to the truth we have to truly consider the possibility that the incident may have been a false flag hoax, i.e. a drill with crisis actors, fake ammo and fake blood. However, in this case, I personally know someone I trust who said their daughter’s friends were shot and injured. So: did real people die in this Las Vegas false flag operation? Was it a mixture of real casualties and crisis actors? Let’s take a look at the evidence and you can decide for yourself.
 
Las Vegas False Flag: Real or Hoax? A Look at the Evidence
 
Right off the bat, the official narrative is very difficult to swallow for many reasons. It seems impossible for an out-of-shape 64 year old man, with no military training, to kill 59 people and injure 500 from the height and distance he was at in the time he was said to have fired. Many videos have exposed the muzzle flashes that were occurring around the 4th or 5th floor. If the bullets were even real, there were multiple shooters.
 
However, it is far from proven that there were actually real bullets fired that killed real people. Consider these 3 pieces of eyewitness testimony in this video (embedded above). A man down on the ground claims that:
 
 
“Someone has tapped into the sound system. There’s no hits, no hits. It’s the sound system.”
 
 
Another person in the same video shouted 3 times:
 
 
“They’re not real gunshots.”
 
 
A third person states:
 
 
“I really don’t see anybody actually injured.”
 
 
Someone in the comments below that video claimed they knew someone who died, and linked to this LiveLeak video. However, this video doesn’t definitively prove anyone has died. It shows people who appear to have been hit … including some that bystanders say were hit in the head but are still breathing (is this even possible?). It also shows more of that bright red “blood” that was used during the Boston marathon false flag bombing (see image below).
 
 
Bright red “blood” from the Las Vegas false flag mass shooting. Real or fake? Image credit: LiveLeak
 
 
Where There’s No Smoke, There’s … No Fire
 
If the patsy Stephen Paddock really had discharged his AR-15 rifle for 10+ minutes as we were told, there would have been plumes of smoke emanating from the window from which he was firing … yet in the multiple videos of the event, there was no smoke. Not even a little. Therefore, how can we seriously entertain the notion that real shots were fired from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel?
 
How is it that eyewitnesses in this video at the 9-min. mark were able to see where the alleged shots were coming from, but it took the cops (in CCTV-ville Las Vegas) an entire 72 minutes to get to the scene?
 
 
Las Vegas false flag event: alleged eyewitness Mike Cronk.
 
 
Crisis Actors Busted
 
Remember the crisis actors in false flag ops like 9/11 who just knew too much information right after the event had unfolded – information they could not possibly have known were they not plants, being handled by governmental operatives? This guy on 9/11, “Mark Walsh”, is surrounded by the Men in Black as he trots out his story about how he witnessed the whole event and that the towers collapsed “mostly due to structural failure because the fire was just too intense.” Talk about a scripted narrative! Who talks like that? Who talks like that right in the middle of an emotional crisis? The same type of planted actors can be found in the Las Vegas false flag too. This video exposes some of them who appear to have incredibly detailed information about the event that could not possibly have known unless they were reciting a script.
 
Every false flag shooting or bombing seems to have some key “heroes” who were not only eyewitnesses but also active participants in saving people’s lives. In the case of this Las Vegas false flag op, the MSM have decided to give a lot of air time to a guy we are told is called “Mike Cronk”. Mike apparently saved his buddy “Rob Macintosh”, who, we are told, was shot 3 times in the chest but still survived … and seems to be doing remarkably well in hospital, fully conscious and smiling for the cameras. Amazingly, Cronk didn’t even get any blood on him despite being next to his best friend who got shot in the chest so would have been spurting blood everywhere. This video shows footage of Mike Cronk’s testimony and the “injured” Rob Macintosh who isn’t even hooked up to IV.
 
 
Las Vegas false flag mass shooting: this 4chan user knew about it 3+ weeks in advance.
 
 
Las Vegas False Flag Foreknowledge
 
There are at least 2 examples of foreknowledge here. The first is the Hispanic woman who allegedly told everyone that “you’re all gong to fucking die” 45 minutes before the shooting started. The other is the prediction made by an anonymous user on 4chan (see image above). Truthstream Media shone light on the motive, which is not only the predictable gun control agenda, but also the more specific agenda to roll out metal detectors/body scanners throughout American hotels – as a stepping stone to having them virtually everywhere in society, so that wherever you go you will be monitored, radiated and bombarded with personalized advertising as in The Minority Report.
 
Question everything. Like Sandy Hook and other false flag hoaxes, this Las Vegas false flag op has elements of being a hoax, yet there is also evidence real people were shot. Please post your thoughts and comments.

"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/arts/television/dynasty-reboot-cw.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Farts
","A ‘Dynasty’ for Generation ‘Gossip Girl’ (Mom Can Watch, Too)","The new show arrives Oct. 11 on the CW, whose youth-centered programming has lately relied, with middling results, on superheroes. It has been not so much created as concocted by Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz — who sold soap to an Axe body wash generation with “Gossip Girl” and “The O.C.” — as a layer cake of nostalgia and novelty to tempt both extremes of the 18-49 demographic so coveted by advertisers.
Photo
“We’re changing up the point of entry,” Mr. Schwartz said. “If you were a fan of the original, it honors the spirit of that. And then those new to the show should be ready for a fun, twisted serial.”
“Downton Abbey” and “Billions” have showed that viewers still enjoy the foibles of the rich. But reboots have become iffy propositions, with originals readily available on Amazon Prime and in DVD box sets. The revival of “Dallas,” on TNT, was canceled after three seasons in 2014, even with the draw of original cast members. “Dynasty” has none thus far (one, Gordon Thomson, called the new show “an abomination” in an interview with The Daily Beast). Some fans, however, have hopefully proposed Heather Locklear, the original Sammy Jo and another “Melrose” veteran, to play Alexis, Cristal’s archrival.
But she was nowhere in evidence here this summer on a cavernous soundstage, which was home to an update of the Carrington mansion, where this reporter spent many happy escapist hours as a pre-teen, learning nothing less than how to be a woman.
“Lip-plumping treatments,” Mr. Show, compactly handsome at 55, was muttering in between takes, rolling the phrase around in his mouth like one of the top-shelf brandies Mr. Forsythe’s Blake Carrington favored. “Lip-plumping treatments.”
Blake had just delivered to his headstrong daughter, Fallon (Elizabeth Gillies), the bad news that their family name had been trademarked by her mother, his ex-wife Alexis, for a cosmetics line.
Photo
The “Dynasty” name was also tarnished by the time Mr. Show met Mr. Spelling, whose Holmby Hills, Calif., mansion seemed a version of Blake Carrington’s, on “Melrose.” He remembered the older man as strict and stingy, using so-called honey wagons to remove sewage rather than install proper plumbing, but also possessing a certain thespian gravitas.

“Aaron used to say, putting his hands up and framing your face in a very square, ‘just your face’ way, ‘My shows are all about character,’” Mr. Show said during a break in taping, sitting at a dining table surrounded by expensive art. “He filmed straight-on, close to camera. You could tell an Aaron show in less than a second.”
The new “Dynasty,” in contrast, has Ms. Savage and Mr Schwartz’s own distinct aesthetic. Scenes are shorter: three or four minutes as opposed to six or seven. Skirts are also shorter. Music is louder. Lighting is dimmer. Slo-mo is occasionally deployed. And knowing references are rife, including to Trumps, Kardashians and Murdochs.
That the White House currently contains a real-estate tycoon— familiar from the ’80s, yet — and his scions makes “Dynasty” seem particularly resonant, though of course tangling bloodlines are a dramatic device as old as the ancient Greeks. “From the Clintons to the Kennedys, this isn’t a new thing, our fascination with these really powerful families,” said Nathalie Kelley, who plays Cristal. “But one thing we’ve talked about which is interesting is patriarchy — how much it has shifted, and how much it’s stayed the same.”
The former Krystle (Linda Evans) had been Blake’s secretary, positioned in perpetual saintly opposition to the devious Alexis and meekly tiptoeing around the Carrington mansion like the nameless heroine of Daphne du Maurier’s “Rebecca.”
Photo
“In the original Blake is shutting the door in her face because she has to have a meeting and she’s trying to get a word in about the china or something,” Ms. Kelley said. “She’s not really given much to do besides be beautiful and look after the house.”
This Cristal begins in public relations and goes on to contest fiercely with Fallon to become chief operating officer of the Carrington energy company.
She is also young enough to be his daughter, though Ms. Kelley argued that at 33 she is past an age that could provoke eye rolls. “When I first met with Josh and Stephanie, I was like, ‘I think Cristal needs to be at least in her 30s,’” she said. “I don’t think women around the world are going to be happy with this rich billionaire in his 50s dating someone who’s under 30, and that threshold makes a big difference.”
As Mr. Show put it: “People are younger today. The whole show’s younger.”
Indeed if any demographic is neglected in the new version, it is the Modern Maturity set. Ms. Collins was 48 when she first swept into the courtroom when Blake was being tried for the murder of his son Steven’s male lover; Mr. Forsythe was 63. Later additions from the golden age of Hollywood, Diahann Carroll and Rock Hudson, were in their 50s — the latter’s death of AIDS in 1985 provoking a national conversation about whether he’d jeopardized Ms. Evans’s health with their onscreen kiss.

As the cast awaits its Alexis, conflict has been heightened between Cristal and Fallon: a role played first by Pamela Sue Martin, then known for “Nancy Drew” and “The Poseidon Adventure,” and subsequently by the British actress Emma Samms, in one of those switcheroos that soap viewers are supposed to accept unblinkingly but now discuss for years afterward in searchable online forums. (A casting change for Steven was attributed to plastic surgery following an explosive accident on an oil rig, but producers decided simply to ignore Fallon’s change in appearance.)
Photo
As embodied by Ms. Gillies, Fallon has been upgraded from a somewhat lost soul, climbing in and out of beds and winsomely up trees — and later, on a spin-off called “The Colbys,” being abducted by aliens — to an ambitious businesswoman, still sleeping with the chauffeur but now also leaning in with a steely glare.
Ms. Gillies, 24, said she had admired Ms. Collins since seeing her in “The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas” as a child and now regularly retweets the older woman’s Throwback Thursday hashtags to her own 4.6 million followers (thanks mainly to her role on “Victorious”). “I’m not playing Alexis but Fallon has inherited a lot of her gusto,” Ms. Gillies said. “She’s less passive than at least Pamela Sue Martin was — she had a relaxed nature. I wouldn’t say that my Fallon is as relaxed, for better or for worse. I think she’s got a lot more bite.”
She is also entwined enough with Blake that some early viewers have suggested her character resembles Ivanka Trump, and for them Ms. Gillies has developed a one-line rejoinder: “I have better shoes,” she said, striding away in a pair of Christian Louboutin heels.
Neither iteration of “Dynasty” can be separated from its devotion to materialism and the one percent. “I just have memories of how white the rooms were, the carpet — that’s what the rich have,” said Ms. Patrick, the showrunner, who grew up in Atlanta.
But the very rich are not only different from you and me, but from how they used to be. The 2017 Colbys made their money in tech, the Carrington children are concerned about the environment and everyone accepts differences in race and sexual orientation unblinkingly. The once dithering Steven is now “gay and proud,” Ms. Patrick said. “That’s not his issue with his father; it’s that he’s a liberal.”
Mr. Show said he thought “this Blake has a lot more pathology” than his predecessor. Crew members were hammering behind him at the opulent set, with its staircase built for flouncing down O‘Hara-style, and twinkling chandeliers.
“He tells untruths when he doesn’t need to and I don’t know why yet, I’m developing the character,” Mr. Show said. “I’m taking that as seriously as I possibly can, and then it cuts to a catfight.”",1

",Japan's Koike: a political paradox shakes things up ahead of poll,"Head of Japan's Party of Hope and Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike speaks during an election campaign rally in Tokyo, Japan, October 10, 2017. REUTERS/Issei Kato
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Yuriko Koike says she went into politics to be a player, not a bystander.
Now Tokyo’s first female governor is shaking things up as her new “Party of Hope” challenges Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling bloc in an Oct. 22 poll, called by the Japanese leader to seek a fresh mandate after nearly five years in office.
When the Berlin Wall dividing East and West Germany was breached in 1989, Koike was a 37-year-old TV announcer. Three years later, she ran for parliament.
“The world was changing immensely, so I went from news presenter to newsmaker. I decided Japanese politics was moving too slowly and rather than be an outside critic, I should become ... a player on the inside,” Koike told Reuters in an interview.
Koike, who defied Abe’s party last year to run for governor, isn’t seeking a seat in parliament’s lower house herself, but is the driving force – and public face – of her upstart party.
In many ways, Koike is a paradox, interviews with people who know her and a review of her career show.
She’s a global thinker with a nationalist tinge; an entrepreneurial outsider who climbed the ladder with help from old-boy mentors, and a risk taker who has balked at perhaps her biggest gamble by declining to run in the national election now.
Koike has made no secret of her ambition to be Japan’s first woman prime minister – her pet female terrier is nicknamed “So-chan” – a diminutive for “sori” or “premier” in Japanese.
She has already cracked a few glass ceilings.
She became the country’s first female defense minister in 2007, although stepped down after 55 days after a tussle with a top bureaucrat. She was also the first woman to run for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s top leadership post in 2008, but came in a distant third.
Koike comes from a business family in western Japan, a background that sets her apart from many Japanese politicians, including Abe, who are scions of blue-blood political dynasties.
Her origins may account for a style that admirers say has more in common with venture capitalists than staid lawmakers.
“She’s not afraid to take initiatives, which in most of Japan is deeply frowned upon,” said a person who has known her for 25 years and advises on financial reforms. “In Japan, it’s subtlety within riddles, but she’s blunt.”
Koike has a talent for political marketing - critics call it populism - a skill she is using as she tries to differentiate her conservative party from Abe’s equally conservative LDP with promises to “break the fetters” of vested interest politics.

She calls her party’s economic policies “Yurinomics” in contrast to Abe’s “Abenomics, and its platform includes “12 Zeroes” it wants to achieve, including “zero hayfever”, and “zero euthanasia of unwanted pets”.
“DARK SIDE”
A graduate of Cairo University in 1976 who speaks Arabic and English, Koike in some ways has a global perspective and often sings the praises of diversity.
Like Abe, she advocates opening Japan to more highly skilled foreign workers. Also like Abe, she has visited Yasukuni Shrine for war dead, seen in China and South Korea as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism, but told Reuters she would not do so if she became premier.

Koike also espouses some causes dear to Japan’s rightwing, including revising the post-war, pacifist constitution.
In the past, she has even suggested Japan should consider acquiring nuclear weapons, breaking a taboo in the only country to suffer a nuclear attack. She also opposes local voting rights for foreign residents, many of whom are of Korean descent.
“There is a dark side that doesn’t jibe with a more open-minded, dare we say, liberal view,” said her long-time acquaintance.
Koike migrated through several parties before joining the LDP in 2002, only to abandon it after becoming governor.
She counts among her mentors Ichiro Ozawa, a one-time LDP heavyweight who helped engineer the long-ruling party’s ouster in 1993 and again in 2009, as well as popular ex-premier Junichiro Koizumi.
Critics say her career reflects an opportunist streak, while allies call it practical.
”She wants to make change, but she’s also pragmatic – she can make a deal with anyone – Communists or Abe or traditional stakeholders,” said another adviser. “It’s a kind of talent.”
Despite speculation that she would abandon her job as governor to return to parliament, Koike stuck to her decision not to run. Analysts say that’s likely because her party has little chance of defeating Abe’s ruling bloc, but may do well enough for her to take the leap in the next poll.
But those who know Koike say her desire for the nation’s top post remains. “Is she Machiavellian and strategic? The answer is yes. Is she prepared to think for the long run? The answer is yes,” said her long-time acquaintance.
“Is her over-riding ambition to be Japan’s first female prime minister? That is definitely a goal.”",1

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/house-gop-eyes-budget-passage-key-tax-debate-50296484,House passes GOP budget in key step for upcoming tax debate,"The House on Thursday passed a $4.1 trillion budget plan that promises deep cuts to social programs while paving the way for a GOP drive to rewrite the tax code later this year.
The 2018 House GOP budget reprises a controversial plan to turn Medicare into a voucher-like program for future retirees as well as the party's efforts to repeal the ""Obamacare"" health law. Republicans controlling Congress have no plans to actually implement those cuts while they pursue their tax overhaul.
That's especially so in the Senate, where the Budget Committee Thursday debated a plan that would permit $1.5 trillion in debt-financed tax cuts that contribute to annual deficits that never drop below $400 billion over the life of the plan.
Instead, the nonbinding budget's chief purpose is to set the stage for a tax overhaul plan that is the party's top political priority as well as a longtime policy dream of key leaders like Speaker Paul Ryan.
The White House issued a statement saying the House plan ""is a key step towards Making America Great Again.""
The plan, passed by a near party-line vote of 219-206, calls for more than $5 trillion in spending cuts over the coming decade, promising to slash Medicaid by about $1 trillion over the next 10 years, cutting other health care costs, and forcing huge cuts to domestic programs funded in future years by Congress.
""It's a budget that will help grow our economy, and it's a budget that will help rein in our debt,"" said Ryan, R-Wis. ""It reforms Medicaid. It strengthens Medicare.""
But Republicans are not actually planning to impose any of those cuts with follow-up legislation that would be required under Washington's Byzantine budget rules. Instead, those GOP proposals for spending cuts are limited to nonbinding promises, and even a token 10-year, $200 billion spending cut package demanded by tea party House Republicans appears likely to be scrapped in upcoming talks with the Senate.
Instead, the motivating force behind the budget measures is the Republicans' party-defining drive to cut corporate and individual tax rates and rid the tax code of loopholes. They promise this tax ""reform"" measure will put the economy in overdrive, driving economic growth to the 3 percent range, and adding a surge of new tax revenues that would help bring the budget toward balance.
Passing the measure in the House and Senate would provide key procedural help for the tax measure because it sets the stage for follow-on legislation that can't be filibustered by Senate Democrats. Republicans used the same so-called reconciliation procedure in their failed attempt to kill ""Obamacare,"" including its tax surcharges on wealthy people.
""Through reconciliation, our budget specifically paves the way for pro-growth tax reform that will reduce taxes for middle class Americans and free up American businesses to grow and hire,"" said Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., who chairs the House Budget Committee.
Eighteen Republicans opposed the measure, including several from high-tax states like New York and New Jersey who are concerned that the upcoming tax effort would repeal the deductions for state and local taxes.
Democrats blasted the sweeping spending cuts proposed by Republicans — more than $5 trillion over 10 years in the House plan and somewhat less in the Senate GOP measure — as an assault on middle-class families and the poor.
""Is it a statement of our values to take a half-trillion dollars out of Medicare to give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in our country?"" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
The House vote comes as the Senate Budget Committee is considering a companion plan that differs in key details — but would still result in a deficit of $424 billion in 2027, according to the Congressional Budget Office — and is set for a vote Thursday afternoon.
The House measure also assumes that the upcoming tax bill won't add to the deficit; the Senate version, however, would permit the measure to add $1.5 trillion to the $20 trillion-plus national debt over the coming 10 years. The final version is likely to stick closely to the Senate measure in key respects, including a $1.5 trillion deficit allowance for the tax rewrite measure. A final House-Senate agreement won't come until November, Black said, but she anticipated conflict over the Senate plan's
""That is certainly going to be a very lively discussion,"" Black said of House-Senate talks. ""Our members are concerned about (budget) balance and they're also concerned about the debt and deficits.""
The real-world trajectory of Washington, however, is for higher deficits as Republicans focus on tax cuts, a huge hike in the defense budget, and a growing disaster aid tally that is about to hit $45 billion.
""The train's left the station, and if you're a budget hawk, you were left at the station,"" said Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C.

",Week 5 Rankings (2017): Top 15 Kickers,"Week 5 Rankings (2017): Top 15 Kickers
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
We all want to ignore the kicker… I mean really, we all don’t want to be bothered, do we? However as is the case with defenses every point matters and it would be a shame if your week went bad because of decision you chose to ignore. Let’s take a look at how things stand for the coming week, as things get more complicated thanks to the bye weeks:
Greg Zuerlein – Los Angeles Rams – vs. Seattle Matt Prater – Detroit Lions – vs. Carolina Stephen Gostkowski – New England Patriots – at Tampa Bay Dan Bailey – Dallas Cowboys – vs. Green Bay Mason Crosby – Green Bay Packers – at Dallas Robbie Gould – San Francisco 49ers – at Indianapolis Jake Elliott – Philadelphia Eagles – vs. Arizona Ka’imi Fairbairn – Houston Texans – vs. Kansas City Ryan Succop – Tennessee Titans – at Miami Nick Folk – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New England Chandler Catanzaro – New York Jets – at Cleveland Stephen Hauschka – Buffalo Bills – at Cincinnati Graham Gano – Carolina Panthers – at Detroit Jason Myers – Jacksonville Jaguars – at Pittsburgh Adam Vinatieri – Indianapolis Colts – vs. San Francisco
Thoughts:
Obviously you are never going to go into a week expecting a kicker to make 7 field goals, but that’s what Zuerlein did in Week 4. That said, over the first few weeks he is a perfect 14-14 on field goal attempts, with at least 2 field goals each game and more than half of those coming from at least 40 yards (he’s made 7 field goals from 40-49 yards and 1 from 50+ yards). Don’t expect the same types of results, but he’s been too good not to have sitting atop these rankings.
As it is Robbie Gould is a perfect 11-for-11 on field goal attempts this season, and he also plays for an offense that lacks firepower and could consistently have to settle for 3 points. He hasn’t kicked indoors since 2015, but when he did he was a perfect 7-for-7 and he also draws an Indianapolis defense that has allowed plenty of opportunities to opposing kickers. Consider him well worth utilizing if your kicker is on bye.
Since 2015 Matt Prater is 35-for-37 when kicking at Ford Field. Kicking at home again this week it’s impossible not to include him among the Top 3 options in the league, and if you wanted to put him at #1 it’s believable.
Mason Crosby has only gotten 4 field goal attempts, though with the running game banged up it’s possible that the Packers need to settle for 3 points more often. We know what Crosby can do and the Cowboys just allowed 7 field goals in a game. Consider him well worth using.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - He runs a company that is a byword for technological innovation -- but Nokia’s chairman had no qualms about going back to school to learn more about artificial intelligence (AI).
Risto Siilasmaa, 51, said he signed up this summer for online courses on AI programming run by Stanford University.
“I realized that I don’t have deep enough knowledge on this phenomenon... Now I‘m back studying programming after 30 years,” he told Reuters on Friday by email.
“I do not want to become an AI programmer. I want to deeply understand the abilities and limitations of AI.”
Since starting the courses, Siilasmaa said he had briefed the Finnish telecom infrastructure firm’s board and managers on the subject.
“I want to raise awareness ...on this, because AI will be a key driver of the ongoing industrial revolution.”
Once the preserve of researchers, artificial intelligence has grabbed the attention of businesses from healthcare to financial services looking to use algorithms to parse data in search of patterns to solve problems.
Nokia aims to offer more sophisticated software to analyze the mountains of data that telecom network operators collect, in order to create more powerful and more personalized services.
Potential AI applications Nokia has begun to roll out this year include troubleshooting network bottlenecks and traffic analysis for use in driverless cars and “smart cities” filled with billions of network-linked devices.
Siilasmaa received plaudits for transforming the Finnish company from an ailing mobile phone manufacturer into one of the world’s biggest telecoms network equipment makers.
“I’ve noticed that when doing something ...that people are not used to see the chairman doing, that inspires people and encourages them to think out of the box,” he added.
Nokia sold the phone business to Microsoft in 2014, which has largely abandoned the mobile device market.
Nokia’s name recently returned to the smartphone market via a brand-licensing deal with HMD Global.

",Review: Money Can’t Buy the New ‘Dynasty’ Excitement,"The Carrington family is still in the energy business, though now fracking and green power are in the mix. The patriarch, Blake (Grant Show, his casting a callback to the ‘90s soap “Melrose Place”), is getting remarried to his employee Cristal (Nathalie Kelley). (Linda Evans’ new-bride character in the original, Blake’s former secretary, was Krystle; now it’s spelled like the champagne.)
Ths doesn’t sit well with Blake’s daughter, Fallon (Elizabeth Gillies), who had expected to inherit the company. (She’s particularly busy, serving as the narrator and in her spare time, sleeping with the chauffeur.) The ensuing machinations also pull in Blake’s estranged, gay, environmentalist son, Steven (James Mackay), and the family’s adversaries, the Colbys.
For nostalgic fans of the original, this might seem like an unnecessary homage. For the CW’s target fan base, born largely after the original went off the air, it’s a retread of themes from more exciting soaps. For everyone, it’s so far forgettable.
This “Dynasty” is created by Josh Schwartz, Stephanie Savage and Sallie Patrick, a pedigree that raised higher hopes. In “The O.C.” Mr. Schwartz infused the teen-soap genre with pop-culture-conscious humor; in “Gossip Girl,” he and Ms. Savage created a luscious, silver-tongued exploration of private-school debauchery and intrigue.

“Dynasty,” on the other hand, is obvious in plot and dialogue. It’s the kind of show where you know you’ve met the black sheep of the family because he says, “I’m the black sheep,” and Fallon’s secret lover welcomes her back to sultry Atlanta by saying, “It wasn’t as hot without you here.”
The casting is at least promising. Ms. Gillies (“Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll”) seizes the screen as the lusty, ambitious Fallon, and Alan Dale is imperious as the snooty Carrington butler (another holdover figure from the original). And the show’s depiction of luxury is even more over-the-top, maybe reflecting a world in which the 0.001 percent are richer and more powerful than in the 1980s.
But it all feels superfluous. Then again, the original “Dynasty” didn’t really have its zing until the second season, when villainess Alexis (Joan Collins) put the “nasty” into its title. The same character is referenced in the new pilot, but I’m not sure this “Dynasty” can wait a full year for its Alexis to arrive. Someone charter her a jet.",1

The North Korean government has responded furiously to a show of military force by the United States.
 
US bombers were deployed to fly close to the east coast of North Korea to demonstrate their full range of military options if North Korea were to launch a pre-emptive on their allies on the United States itself. This flight is the farthest north of any US bomber in the twenty-first century.
 
<img src=""http://fs5.directupload.net/images/170923/v74jpg22.png"">
 
The Pentagon has released a statement with regards to the flight claiming that it was a show of force intended to show the North Koreans how seriously the United States was taking its ‘reckless’ behavior with regards to its nuclear weapon programme. ""This mission is a demonstration of US resolve and a clear message that the president has many military options to defeat any threat, ” read the statement, ""We are prepared to use the full range of military capabilities to defend the US homeland and our allies.""
 
Representatives from the North Korean government have responded furiously to the United States’ military action with the foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho saying that President Donald Trump was on a suicide mission. Earlier in the week, President Trump made an incendiary speech at the United Nations where he said that the United States would ‘destroy’ North Korea if it was deemed to be necessary. Ri said that these ‘insults’ by the president indicated that he was ‘mentally deranged and full of megalomania’ and that if the military action were to continue, then it would be an inevitability that North Korea would be forced to fire missiles at the US mainland. President Trump responded to Ri’s comments on Twitter where he threatened that neither the foreign minister nor Kim Jong-Un would ‘be around much longer’ if they were to continue with their rhetoric.
 
The assembly of the United Nations has been a tightening of sanctions against North Korea because of its unauthorized nuclear weapons programme. However, the hermit kingdom has refused to give up its nuclear weapons despite the successive rounds of sanctions because it is believed to be their greatest defense against the outside world.

",Four ways Bob Corker skewered Donald Trump,"Image copyright Getty Images
On Sunday morning, Donald Trump went off on a Twitter tirade against a member of his own party.
This, in itself, isn't exactly huge news. It's far from the first time the president has turned his rhetorical cannons on his own ranks.
This time, however, his attacks were particularly biting and personal. He essentially called Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, the chair of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a coward for not running for re-election.
He said Mr Corker ""begged"" for the president's endorsement, which he refused to give. He wrongly claimed that Mr Corker's support of the Iranian nuclear agreement was his only political accomplishment.
Unlike some of his colleagues, Mr Corker - free from having to worry about his immediate political future - didn't hold his tongue.
Skip Twitter post by @SenBobCorker It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning. — Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) October 8, 2017 Report
That wasn't the end of it, though. He then spoke with the New York Times and really let the president have it. Here are four choice quotes from the Tennessee senator's interview with the Times and why they are particularly damning.
""I don't know why the president tweets out things that are not true. You know he does it, everyone knows he does it, but he does.""
You can't really sugarcoat this one. Mr Corker is flat-out saying the president is a liar - and everyone knows it.
The senator, in particular, is challenging Mr Trump's insistence that he unsuccessfully pleaded for his endorsement, but the accusation is much broader.
Mr Corker and the president used to be something akin to allies. The Tennessean was on Mr Trump's short list for vice-president and secretary of state.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bob Corker at Trump campaign rally in July 2016
Those days are seemingly very much over now - and it's not like Mr Corker is going anywhere anytime soon. Although he's not running for re-election, he'll be in the Senate, chairing a powerful committee, until January 2019.
The president's margin for success in that chamber is razor-thin. If Democrats can continue to stand together in opposition, he can afford to lose only two votes out of 52 Republican senators. That's why healthcare reform collapsed in July - and it could be bad news for tax efforts.
From here on out, Mr Corker isn't going to do the president any favours.
""Look, except for a few people, the vast majority of our caucus understands what we're dealing with here.""
Frustration in Congress has been growing over what Republicans feel has been the president's inability to focus on advancing their agenda. Getting a sharply divided party to come together on plans to repeal Obamacare, reform taxes or boost infrastructure spending is challenging enough. Doing so when the president stirs up unrelated controversies on a seemingly daily basis makes things all the harder.
One of the president's gifts has been his ability to shake off negative stories by quickly moving on to a different subject. That worked brilliantly during his presidential campaign, but it's less effective during the legislative slow grind.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Corker at the confirmation hearing for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
For months, Republicans in Congress have been grumbling about this in the background and among themselves. Occasionally, someone like Mr McConnell will lament that the president doesn't understand how the Senate works.
Mr Corker has now stated it loud and clear. And, what's more, he says almost everyone agrees with him. They've kept silent until now because they still hope to pass conservative legislation that the president can sign or fear Mr Trump's legions will back a primary challenge next year or stay home during the general election.
If that calculus ever changes - if it becomes riskier to stay silent than speak out - Mr Trump will be in real trouble.
""A lot of people think that there is some kind of 'good cop, bad cop' act underway, but that's just not true.""
Time and again, Mr Trump has appeared to undercut Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others in his administration who are attempting to use soft diplomacy to deal with a range of international crises.
The war against the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran's compliance with the multinational nuclear agreement, the ongoing dispute between Qatar and its Persian Gulf neighbours, the unrest in Venezuela and, most recently, North Korea's continued ballistic missile tests have all been the target of the president's offhand remarks and Twitter invective.
Some administration defenders have said this is all a part of Mr Trump's strategy - an updated version of the Nixon-era ""madman theory"", in which the president forces adversaries to give way because they fear an unpredictable US leader's actions.
Mr Corker isn't buying it. There's no strategy, he says, just the possibility of chaos - which he hopes Mr Trump's senior advisers will be able to avoid.
""I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it's a situation of trying to contain him.""
There's now a growing collection of John Kelly face-palm photos that serve as a testament to the chief-of-staff's reported frustration at dealing with the president.
Mr Trump goes off-script to praise torch-bearing white nationalists at a rally in Charlottesville, and Mr Kelly is captured closing his eyes and rubbing the arch of his nose, as if attempting to stave off a migraine.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption White House Chief of Staff John Kelly looks on as US President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally
The president calls North Korean leaders ""criminals"" in a speech to the United Nations, and Mr Kelly straight-up buries his face in his hands.
The White House communications team is often left scrambling to try to explain or reframe an indelicate presidential ""joke"" or remark that directly contradicts what was until then the official administration line.
Even though Mr Kelly has brought some discipline to the West Wing staff, the president still marches to the beat of his own drum - and continues to have unfettered access to his phone's Twitter app.
Bob Corker is only the latest person - politician, journalist, sports star or celebrity - to feel the mercurial president's uncontainable ire.",1

This is not going to be your traditional Steelers/Ravens matchup Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium.
There is still angst among both fanbases over players taking a knee during the National Anthem in Week 3. If social media is any indication, many fans plan to boycott this week’s game. Some have even vowed to never watch the NFL again.
A petition to tear down the Ray Lewis statue at M&T Bank Stadium has gotten so much attention extra security was hired to protect the monument.
It’s a divisive topic because there is also a large group of fans that support the player’s stance and their right to freedom of speech.
This is easily the most volatile period in Ravens history.
The coaches and players understand the anger of some of the fans. However, John Harbaugh was more focused on putting together a game plan for the Steelers, rather than worrying about how many people are going to be watching from the stands.
The winner of this game will take over first place in the AFC North at the quarter point of the season.
“We’re spending our time getting ready for the game,” Harbaugh said this week. “That’s what you do as a coach. That was my first point. That’s what we’re doing; we’re getting ready for this game. We had a morning full of meetings on the opponent we’re going to play – the Pittsburgh Steelers – who we respect tremendously. We’re getting ready to play a football game, and that’s what we do, and that’s all we can do.
“The other issues are bigger than that; they are beyond our ability to address and deal with that, but we can focus on the task at hand, and that’s our responsibility. That’s our job, and that’s what we’re required to do.”
The players have stayed unified in their support for one another. The protest is supposed to bring more attention to social injustice. However, it was also a reaction to comments made by President Donald Trump, who said players should be fired for taking a knee.
“Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a (expletive) off the field right now,” Trump said, via USA Today. “Out. He’s fired. He’s fired!’”
These comments did not go over well with the players and this boosted the movement for taking a knee.
In Week 3, Steelers left tackle Alejandro Villanueva broke rank and stood in the tunnel with his hand over his heart during the Anthem while his teammates stayed in the locker room. The following day, he had the top selling jersey in the NFL, but later said it was “very embarrassing” for not going along with the rest of the players’ plan.
The players on the Ravens plan to stay unified. The team has already discussed what they are going to do during the National Anthem on Sunday. However, they are keeping those plans private until the actual moment arrives.
If the Bears/Packers game on Thursday night was any indication, the players and coaches will lock arms, rather than kneeling. The players appear to be tired of the controversy and answering questions about whether they plan to kneel.
“We have to get back to playing football eventually, so we are going to keep it private amongst the team, but our main focus this week is the Pittsburgh Steelers,” linebacker Terrell Suggs said about Sunday.
At this point, we could all use some normalcy.

",British author Rowling says Trump has a right to be bigoted,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling labeled U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump bigoted after receiving the PEN/Allen Foundation Literary Service Award in New York.
Rowling, who won the prize for her efforts to fight inequality and censorship, criticized the presumptive Republican nominee, who has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.
But the British author stuck up for Trump’s right to visit the United Kingdom, despite the outrage his remarks had caused in her homeland.
“I find almost everything that Mr. Trump says objectionable. I consider him offensive and bigoted. But he has my full support to come to my country and be offensive and bigoted there,” Rowling said to applause from the audience on Monday.
In January, British lawmakers debated a petition signed by more than half a million Britons to ban Trump from Britain over remarks on Muslims, before deciding the Republican candidate should he allowed to visit so his views could be challenged.
Rowling wrote on Twitter last year that Voldemort, the arch-villain of her popular Harry Potter series which has been published in over 200 territories and spawned eight films and three theme parks, “was nowhere near as bad” as Trump.

","Nusra Front, Islamic State clash in Syria's Hama province","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Islamic State took control of some Syrian villages in a rebel-controlled area east of Hama on Monday, opening a new frontline days after the Syrian military said it had cleared Islamic State from a nearby area.
Islamic State said in a statement it had taken control of 12 villages and carried out a big attack on the jihadist alliance Tahrir al-Sham.
Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by al Qaeda’s former affiliate the Nusra Front, said in its own statement that Islamic State had stormed several villages and accused the Syrian army of allowing it to cross government territory.
A war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Islamic State had taken 15 villages from Tahrir al-Sham, but that the jihadist alliance then took five of them back.
On Friday the Syrian army said it had cleared Islamic State from its last pocket of territory in a nearby part of the countryside east of Hama after months of fighting.
The Observatory and Tahrir al-Sham said those same fighters were the ones that captured the villages, appearing to have crossed government-held territory. The Observatory said some of them had crossed with groups of civilians.
Although Islamic State and the groups that make up Tahrir al-Sham, including the Nusra Front, subscribe to hardline jihadist ideology, they have opposed each other for years.
Islamic State has not held territory abutting areas held by jihadists or other rebel groups in northwest Syria, the most populous area held by the insurgency, since last year.
It has since lost swathes of ground to the Syrian army, backed by Russia, Iran and Shi‘ite militias, and a rival campaign by Kurdish and Arab groups in the north supported by the United States.

","'Ball in your court:' Britain, EU clash over next Brexit move","LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain and its European Union partners clashed on Monday over which side should make the next move to unblock Brexit talks, despite concerns they will miss a deadline for a divorce deal and that London is heading for a chaotic departure.
Prime Minister Theresa May made clear in a speech she delivered to parliament that she hoped her EU partners would make proposals at a new round of talks opening the way to the next stage of negotiations, saying “the ball is in their court”.
But even before she had delivered her address, an EU spokesman hit back in Brussels, saying “the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen”.
May is desperate to try to regain some of her authority and refocus on talks to unravel 40 years of union after a speech at her party conference last week, marred by a repetitive cough, a prankster and a stage malfunction, left her weaker than ever.
She has so far fought off attempts to unseat her by critics already angry over an ill-judged election when she lost her governing Conservatives’ majority. But her weakness has opened the door for many in the party to challenge her Brexit strategy with just 18 months to go before Britain leaves the EU.
With Brussels quietly preparing for a collapse in the talks and Britain getting ready for what May calls “every eventuality”, some officials and business chiefs worry the country will crash out of the EU without a deal.
Speaking in parliament, May said her negotiators had made progress on the first phase of talks, tackling the rights of expatriates and the border with EU-member Ireland, and that she was determined to secure a new partnership with the other 27 members of the wealthy political and trade bloc.
“Achieving that partnership will require leadership and flexibility, not just from us but from our friends, the 27 nations of the EU,” she told a raucous session of parliament.
“And as we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response.”
But the EU stuck to its terms: “There is a clear sequencing to these talks and there has been so far no solution found on step one, which is the divorce proceedings,” European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a regular briefing. “So the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen.”
“SEE WHAT HAPPENS”
May, who hosted businesses on Monday to listen to their Brexit concerns, is keen to push the talks beyond a discussion of the divorce to try to offer firms some certainty about future trading conditions.

According to a source familiar with the matter, May told business leaders that for her, a roughly two-year transitional agreement was non-negotiable. “It will happen,” the source said when asked what May had spoken about.
She also said her government had no intention of revoking Article 50, which triggered the Brexit talks in March this year, and stopping Britain’s departure.
But a lack of progress in talks some 15 months after Britain voted to leave the EU in a referendum has added pressure on May, who was criticized by the opposition for failing to offer any clarity on what the future relationship will look like.
“Now the reality for this Tory (Conservative) government is beginning to bite, but if things do not improve, the reality may soon begin to bite for the jobs and living standards of the people of this country,” said Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party.

A report that aerospace manufacturer BAE Systems (BAES.L) is planning to cut more than 1,000 jobs did little to ease those concerns that without progress in the talks, firms will start to make staffing and relocation decisions.
EU negotiators say that while they see no big breakthrough at the summit next week, they may offer May a hand by offering hope of a shift at the next scheduled meeting in mid-December.
Aides to May have signaled that the prime minister has accepted that her October deadline will not be met despite a speech in Italy last month which attempted to reset the tone of the difficult negotiations.
But some pro-Brexit campaigners are calling on the prime minister to get ready to step away from the talks - underlining the deep divisions in the Conservative Party.
Those differences were aired again on Monday with negative briefings in the local media against finance minister Philip Hammond, who supports prolonging the status quo with the EU for as long as possible, and foreign minister Boris Johnson, who angered some Conservatives for setting his own Brexit red lines.
Some have suggested that May will reshuffle her cabinet, but her spokesman said she had full confidence in both ministers.
“We are fast reaching the point when the prime minister should assert the authority of her office over the negotiations and call time,” Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative lawmaker, wrote in the Guardian newspaper.
John Baron, another pro-Brexit campaigner, called on the government to “prepare more thoroughly for a ‘no deal’”.
“I have long believed that the EU Commission primarily wants to punish Britain for daring to leave the organization,” he said. “We should have no fears about a ‘no deal’ scenario.”

","India, Japan to team up to get more flexible LNG deals","NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will work with Japan to make long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) import deals more affordable for its price-sensitive consumers, it said on Wednesday, as these two big importers try to secure better prices and concessions from suppliers.
The arrangement will help state-run GAIL India Ltd swap a part of its 5.8 million tonnes of LNG booked with firms from the United States with that of Japan’s contracted volumes in Asia and elsewhere, Sunjay Sudhir, joint secretary for international cooperation in India’s federal oil ministry, told Reuters.
The world’s biggest LNG buyers, all in Asia, are increasingly clubbing together to secure more flexible supply contracts in a move that shifts power to importers from producers in an oversupplied market.
An alliance of big buyers puts pressure on exporters such as Qatar, Australia and Malaysia. They prefer to have clients locked into fixed supply contracts that run for decades and make buyers take fixed amounts of monthly volumes irrespective of demand, with no right to re-sell surplus supplies to other end-users.
“Without joining any club, we would like to work with other major consumers to promote a flexible and open LNG market,” Sudhir said.
India’s cabinet on Wednesday approved the proposal to sign a Memorandum of Cooperation with Japan that it said would help to diversify gas supplies, strengthen energy security and lead to more competitive prices.
Japan is the world’s largest LNG importer, and India the fourth biggest.
Under the arrangement, the two countries will try to get more flexibility in LNG contracts and abolish the Destination Restriction Clause, which prevents them from re-selling imports to third parties.
“The agreement will have a swap clause as well, like we can swap our Australian LNG from Gorgon project with LNG booked by Japan with Qatar,” India’s oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who is traveling to Japan next week, told reporters.
India last month agreed to buy more LNG from the Gorgon project after Exxon Mobil agreed to cut prices under a long-term deal.
India and Japan will also look at establishing LNG spot price indices that reflect true supply and demand.
Pradhan earlier this week said that India wanted to set up a gas trading exchange for transparent market-driven prices that would encourage investment into the sector.
India wants to increase its share of gas in its energy mix from about 6.5 percent now to about 15 percent in the next few years. Locally produced gas is sold at a government-set price formula.
The president of Japan’s JERA Co, the world’s biggest LNG importer, told Reuters on Wednesday that his firm was set to sign a new LNG contract that would be free of destination restrictions.
LNG markets have been marked by oversupply since 2014 as production has jumped.",1

",Blackhawks Roster Breakdown: Goalies,"Blackhawks Roster Breakdown: Goalies
(Before It's News)
With opening night less than a week away, the Blackhawks are down to some tough decisions with their roster. We talked at length about the options on Tuesday night’s Shoutcast, but there are some real questions. I’m going to break down some of the upcoming roster decisions or at least try to lay them out in a logical manor. This doesn’t mean Joel Quenneville decide to use the logical method. First, we look at my favorites, the goalies, which is the only position that is seemingly locked down.
Corey Crawford is the clear and unquestioned number one. He had has his injury bugs each year, but he is still a top 10 goalie in this league. We can all expect another injury at some point this year. It is inevitable. Crawford will continue his solid, unspectacular performance, and continue to be overlooked, as well as under rated. He won’t truly be appreciated until the Cup window is secured shut and this generation of players are retired. It is a shame that the guy gets so much angst from fans that don’t truly understand the intricacies of the position, but it is the nature of the sport and Chicago.
Sneaky offseason acquisition Anton Forsberg will back up Corey Crawford. Before camp began, I honestly thought that Jean-Francois Berube had a solid chance to challenge Forsberg for the backup job, but Berube had a pretty rusty performance against the Blue Jackets. This opened the door wide open for Forsberg. All he needs to do is be solid tonight in Detroit, and the race is officially over. Forsberg really impressed me in his opening game vs the Blue Jackets. He was big in net, quick in the crease, and composed. His reflexes are very good for a big guy. I am now aboard the Forsberg train. If he can keep this up, he’ll be a perfectly fine replacement for Scott Darling.
My dark horse this camp was Jean-Francois Berube, and he simply just didn’t deliver in his one opportunity. His first goal against was more the lack of support from his team, but he got a piece of the Ryan Murray shot. The last two goals against were pretty sloppy. There is no excuse to be giving up a goal off the end boards, from virtually behind the net, like he did to Lucas Sedlak. The third goal was a weak backhand less than a minute later by Oliver Bjorkstrand, that was actually defended alright by Brent Seabrook, which softly went 5-hole. He will be fine in Rockford, if he sneaks through waivers, and “should be” the number one guy there, but Jeff Glass is a former teammate of new coach Jeremy Colliton, so that could affect the game distribution. If Crawford or Forsberg get hurt, Berube is a fine option as well.
Jeff Glass is just a veteran depth guy that can be a leader in the locker room for the kids and provide some valuable consistent experience in the Icehogs backup role. If Glass ends up being counted on for more than a leadership role, then there are real problems.
First year pro (and Puckin Hostile favorite), Collin Delia doesn’t figure into the pro team’s plans this year, or even maybe next, but this will be an important season for him to earn a reputation and gather some crucial experience. Expect him to probably start the season in Indy, with the Fuel, and share time with Matt Tomkins. If Delia can have a solid season in Indy, we could see him get some time in Rockford as the season progresses. He has the potential and certainly has the talent. The fanboy in me wants to see Delia get some Rockford time and wow the pants off everyone, but the pragmatist in me says that isn’t realiztec to expect.
Matt Tomkins is signed to an AHL deal and will eventually end up in Indy with Delia. While I was certainly fine with Jake Hildebrand and Eric Levine in the ECHL last year, Delia and Tomkins are an upgrade to the depth of the organization. Hildebrand was just alright as the primary netminder in Indy, but was overmatched in the few times he actually saw the ice in Rockford. He today signed a tryout with the Tulsa Oilers of the ECHL. Levine was a temporary solution to the thin goaltending depth in the organization, as was Jeff Glass, and wasn’t even all that good in Indy.

","Henry McLeish insists Scotland are at a ""new low"" in international football","Scotland were 1-0 up at half time in Slovenia but had to settle for a damaging 2-2 draw
Former first minister Henry McLeish says Scotland have ""exhausted"" all excuses after hitting ""a new low"" on the international football scene.
McLeish led a review into Scottish football in 2010 but says things are even worse now after Scotland's latest failure to reach a major tournament.
He insists a major part of the problem is the balance of power between club sides and the national team.
""I think we have reached a new low,"" McLeish told BBC Scotland.
""In 2010 when we did the review, we thought we had really reached the nadir of our fortunes but look, if we're slipping past 20 years of not qualifying in Europe or globally, if we go to 25 years or 30 years at its most pessimistic, this is deeply damaging to the national psychology of the game and to the inevitability of us ever getting there.""
Henry McLeish, who played for East Fife, led the review into Scottish Football in 2010
A 2-2 draw in Slovenia on Sunday evening denied Scotland second place in Group F and a possible World Cup qualification play-off spot.
The Scots have now failed to qualify for the last 10 major international tournaments, and McLeish believes the problems lie with the balance of power in the game.
""We've virtually exhausted all the excuses we can have and I don't believe for a minute that talent doesn't exist in Scotland, but I do believe that the current structure of the game is still preventing us getting the best, nurturing them and putting them through,"" he added.
""When I talk about excuses, people say that young people have distractions, well, they have them in Iceland. Here, we have stripped bare all of the excuses you could possibly put forward, we're simply not good enough and that should be the wake-up call that all those who love the game and want Scotland to be successful.
""I have no doubt there needs to be a rebalancing of power, priorities, and objectives within the game. That really means that the SFA have got to become a much more influential part of the footballing establishment. There needn't be a conflict between club and country, but I fear at the present time there is.
Gordon Strahcan said after the Slovenia match that genetics were a major part of Scotland's problem
""I think the tentacles of the club game are so intertwined now with the ambitions of the country game, and that is not what I would like to see. We need clear demarcations of responsibility and I put it quite boldly to say that the SFA must now become the dominant political institution in Scottish football. The two institutions of the SPFL and the SFA have got to rearrange and reprioritise what their objectives are and the country, in my view, must overcome the power of the club.""
McLeish, who pointed to the women's team and the under-21s as ""bright embers"" for the Scottish game, also felt national boss Gordon Strachan's comments about genetics being part of the problem, were misunderstood.
""Clearly in the aftermath of his bitter disappointment and reflections, I think Gordon used the wrong word,"" McLeish added.
""I think what he was talking about was physicality, this is the size and stature of our players, but with the greatest respect to Gordon, that's not the start and finish of the difficulties we face. We have to do a great deal more.""",1

(Before It's News)
The Chicago Bears took on the Green Bay Packers lastThursday night with full momentum on their side after a thrilling overtime win against the Pittsburgh Steelers. But the momentum was gone after the first play on offense once the game started as Mike Glennon was sacked and fumbled, giving the Packers a quick 14-0 lead. The Bears never recovered. The loss is just another notch added to a growing trend that is terrible for the Bears as this is their 8th loss in their last 10 games on the road against the Packers. Even worse, all but one of those losses has been by 13 points are more and all have been on national television. Since 2011, All the of the Bears Packers games played at Lambeau Field have taken place during primetime, whether it be Sunday, Monday, or Thursday night. The last three contest have all been on Thursday night, with the first one being on Thanksgiving Night back in 2015 which actually was the Bears last win at Lambeau Field with the score being 17-13. The last two losses have been by a combined score of 37 points and the team has had three quarterbacks play as well, as last season starting quarterback Brian Hoyer broke his arm in the game and missed time last season.
Mike Glennon looked a lot like Jay Cutler last night for the Packers. Check out the rest of the highlights here: https://t.co/4CFCsVXHhz pic.twitter.com/OeUqzDbY68 — TheTundraEffect (@TundraEffect) September 29, 2017
The first of the consecutive primetime games came on Christmas Day in 2011 when the Bears were blown out 35-21.That game sawJosh McCown made his first start with Bears, the offense did rack up yards, but did turn the ball over twice. The 2011 team for that game was without quarterback Jay Cutler, running back Matt Forte, and wide receiver Johnny Knox who suffered a career-ending back injury the week before. The loss knocked the Bears out of the playoffs and dropped their record to seven and eight on the season. From 2012 to 2014, The Bears played the Packers in primetime on a different night each year. The first was a Thursday night game in week two of the 2012 season, the Bears were coming off a blow out victory against the Indianapolis Colts in the season opener and were in high spirits going into the game. Jay Cutler threw four interceptions and was sacked seven times as the Bears lost 23-10. In 2013 with new head coach Marc Trestman, Bears played on Monday Night in what would be the signature win in Trestman’s ill-fated coaching career with the Bears. Without Cutler and a very bad pass defense, the Bears upset the Packers 27-20 as backup quarterback Josh McCown started once again and had a phenomenal game throwing two touchdowns and posted a quarterback rating of 90.7. The Packers lost Aaron Rodgers early in the game due to a broken collarbone which was vital for the Bears winning the game. Just as the 2013 game at Lambeau was Trestman’s signature win, almost an exact year later, he would suffer his signature loss as a coach and it marked the beginning of the end of his tenure as Bears head coach. Coming out of a bye week where the week prior the team had been beaten badly on the road against the New England Patriots 51-23, many experts expected the Bears to play the Packers hard, but just the opposite occurred. Aaron Rodgers posted a historic performance as he threw six touchdowns in the first half alone. To make matters worse, it appeared that many Bears players had all but quit on the field as they showed no sense of motivation or pride to fight back to make the game look respectable. The final score was 55-14 and the Bears had set a franchise record giving up a combined 104 points in two games. The recent history at Lambeau is not pretty for the Bears organization or the fan base as coaching staffs and players have change, but results have been the same. What makes matters worse is that all these performances have been witnessed in primetime by a national audience which only enhances the severity of the losses. One can only hope that next season could be the first since 2010 to where the Bears play the Packers in Green Bay on a traditional Sunday afternoon and not in primetime. With the most recent outcome on Thursday evening, there is only hope that this last Bears game in Green Bay will be the last in a very dubious stretch of bad play against a rival that makes up the NFL’s oldest rivalry. The Lions back in 2015 snapped a 24-game losing streak when playing against the Packers in Green Bay, if the Lions did it maybe there’s hope for the Bears.

",Chinese Village Where Xi Jinping Fled Is Now a Monument to His Power,"But more than that, Mr. Xi’s story embodies the authoritarian values he wants to restore in China — a “red-brown” melding of Communist revivalism and earthy nationalism rooted in a glorified rendering of China’s ancient past. Liberal-minded members of China’s middle class bridle at that ideology. But others, including farmers and blue-collar workers, find a lot to like in Mr. Xi’s appeals to patriotic pride and homespun populism.

“Xi has the perfect résumé. He’s a son of the revolution, but not a child of privilege,” said Trey McArver, a political analyst and co-founder of Trivium/China, which advises companies working in China. “What Xi’s story says clearly is: He is a Communist born and bred, but he also understands the common people.”
This story line resonates with many of the nearly 18 million Chinese who were also sent to the countryside by Mao in a mass effort to re-educate urban youth in the rustic virtues of China’s peasant majority, while defusing the fanaticism of the Red Guards. This so-called sent-down generation now holds the reins of the Communist Party, including four spots on the Politburo Standing Committee, the party’s highest rung of power.
Members of that generation said Mr. Xi shared not only their experiences, but also their values of frugality and perseverance. They said that these had been lost in younger Chinese, especially those in urban centers like Beijing, who grew up after their nation’s economic takeoff.
“Beijingers who weren’t sent to the countryside can’t handle nearly as much hardship as those of us who did,” said Xia Baoqing, 66, who was also sent to work near Liangjiahe. “Of course, President Xi has some similar characteristics. He encourages thrift and avoiding waste, and he’s very self-disciplined.”
The emergence of Liangjiahe as a popular tourist site attests to Mr. Xi’s speed in propelling himself to the center of Chinese politics. He is poised to entrench his power at a Communist Party congress this month. As it approaches, party newspapers and a new book have promoted the official line that Mr. Xi is a strong leader with close ties to the common people because of his time in Liangjiahe.
“Finding high purpose in suffering always makes a good story. This is one such case,” said Guobin Yang, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied the Cultural Revolution generation. “Like Mao, he is from the people, so the future legend might go.”

But even with the worshipful official biography, it remains unclear how far Mr. Xi can go in consolidating power.

While Mr. Xi is expected to use the congress to fill more of the party’s top tier with his backers, he could face stiff opposition, especially if he tries to keep his top ally and anticorruption overseer, Wang Qishan, in office despite reaching the usual retirement age.
Still, no other recent Chinese leader has amassed as much power as Mr. Xi, 64. And no leader since Mao has used his personal biography to this extent in asserting his right to lead.
“There has been that sea change, and his style of leadership is much more personalist,” said Patricia Thornton, a professor of Chinese politics at Oxford.
Just as Shaoshan did for Mao, Liangjiahe has come to figure prominently in Mr. Xi’s official biography. When he arrived at the age of 15 in early 1969, as one of millions of Chinese youth sent to the countryside by Mao, the village’s 360 residents lived in caves dug into the dry, ocher-colored hillsides, and eked a meager existence out of the dusty soil. According to the current narrative, Mr. Xi showed his first signs of greatness in the then-penniless village, rising to a position of local party leadership.
“The experience of being steeled by being sent to rural Liangjiahe was the wellspring of Xi Jinping’s thinking, mind-set and feelings,” Lei Pingsheng, another student from Beijing who was sent to work in the village, says in a new Chinese-language book, “Xi Jinping’s Seven Years as a Sent-Down Youth.” The book has been heavily promoted by the party-run media before the congress.
These days, Liangjiahe, which is about 380 miles southwest of Beijing, is thronged by officials, many of whom have been ordered to study Mr. Xi’s life.
About 2,500 people visit Liangjiahe each day, People’s Daily reported, and many of them are ferried in on minibuses after paying a $3 ticket. (I was allowed to look around only after registering at the village police station, and was accompanied by a guard who whispered to villagers not to say anything.)
Visitors are given a carefully airbrushed version of China’s recent history. The propaganda about Mr. Xi’s time here offers only hints of the ferocity of the Cultural Revolution that drove him and the other sent-down youth to villages like Liangjiahe in the first place. Mr. Xi has demanded reverence for Mao and banned historians from exploring dark episodes of starvation and persecution that could tarnish the party’s image.

“It’s a selective memory that is about the glories of collective sacrifice for the revolutionary cause,” Suisheng Zhao, a professor at the University of Denver, who was also sent to work in the countryside under Mao.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Mr. Xi’s time in Liangjiahe was also more turbulent than portrayed in these sanitized versions of history, according to less-guarded accounts that Mr. Xi gave before he became national leader.
He was born into political aristocracy, the son of a revolutionary who followed Mao into Beijing after the Communist Party took power. But in 1962, Mao turned against his father, and Mr. Xi’s family was hounded and torn apart during the Cultural Revolution from 1966, when Mao let Red Guards attack his ex-allies. One of Mr. Xi’s sisters died in the mayhem, possibly by taking her own life.
Mr. Xi has also contradicted some key parts of the official story. In a 2004 interview, given when Mr. Xi was still an obscure provincial official, he recalled being glad to go to Liangjiahe because Beijing was more dangerous.
“On the entire train everyone was crying, but I was smiling,” he said. “If I didn’t leave, I didn’t even know if I’d survive.”
After three days of travel by train, truck and foot, Mr. Xi and 14 other youths reached the village, where they were shocked by the levels of poverty. They also suffered an infestation of fleas that left their bodies covered in sores. Mr. Xi said that after a few months he could not cope and returned to Beijing, which the official narrative neglects to mention.
He eventually returned to the village, staying until the Cultural Revolution’s waning days in 1975, when he was allowed to attend university in Beijing. “Liangjiahe gave me everything,” Mr. Xi said as he prepared to leave the village for university, according to the new book, “and I’ll never forget it as long as I live.”",1

",‘Dynasty’ or ‘Dallas’? Squaring Off in the Lily Pond,"JACOBS A fig stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in prosciutto! As played by Pamela Sue Martin (familiar to me from a terrifying afternoon watching “The Poseidon Adventure”), Fallon was my favorite character on the show: intelligent, free-spirited and sexually liberated.
Yes, she was a spoiled brat with an Elektra complex, but also a feminist who wasn’t about to let any man tell her how to live her life, a working mother who single-handedly turns around Blake’s hotel, La Mirage. The chemistry between her and the staid, dependable Jeff Colby (John James) was intoxicating to my preadolescent self.
HEALY Fallon the working mother … hmmm … there are working mothers and then there are Carrington working mothers. And I’m not sure “feminist” is the first word I’d use for someone who was so demeaning and spiteful (at least at first) to other women.
For me, Fallon represented a central flaw of “Dynasty.” The show was a portrait of wealth, glamour, conspicuous consumption and narcissism — nothing more, really. Everyone wanted Blake’s love and money, and to a lesser extent Cecil Colby’s. The sexual politics became increasingly problematic, too: While the men schemed and sabotaged, the women fought over men in lily ponds and apartments.
“Dallas” felt richer for its focus on family and betrayal. (It was not above a pool fight, but those usually involved men.)
Both shows did have great villains. How would you rate J. R. and Joan Collins’s Alexis?
JACOBS No contest. J. R. felt irritatingly underplayed, with a rushed mumbling delivery. His predilection for the insults “slut,” “loser,” “drunk” and “saddle tramp” got old fast.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
HEALY Alexis called Krystle “you bitch!” a fair amount too. Those lines were juvenile, but I was juvenile, and they made me laugh.
JACOBS And she managed to make “whore” a two-syllable word! Alexis was over the top but she was both always herself and constantly changing — and not just outfits. She rolled with whatever crazy story line the writers came up with (quite literally, in the case of the infamous mud-wrestling scene). And she always committed 100 percent, whether it was to singing a rendition of Frank Loesser’s “The Boys in the Back Room” à la Marlene Dietrich or falling off a balcony with Dex in the last season’s final episode.
Which brings us to cliffhangers. Sashaying down memory lane with you made me realize how much the experience of watching television has changed, from once-a-week treat to isolated bingeing-and-tweeting. Who the heck shot J. R., anyway?
HEALY J. R. took it in the chest from his mistress Kristin Shepard (Mary Crosby), Sue Ellen’s scheming sister. That guy was such a dirty dog, but he was also one of the first prime-time villains that viewers loved to hate. He was a forerunner to antiheroes like Tony Soprano, Walter White and Cersei Lannister.
The “Who Shot J. R.?” season finale of “Dallas” was, for me, the greatest TV cliffhanger of all time. It came in March 1980; it wasn’t until November that Kristin was unmasked as the shooter. During the intervening months, everyone from President Carter to Vegas oddsmakers weighed in on J. R. The watercooler energy was enormous. While other television shows had fan followings, “Dallas” demonstrated that you could keep viewers in thrall for much of a year without any new episodes.
“Dynasty” had its own cliffhangers. I’ll bet you a Dean & DeLuca coffee that we agree on the most memorable one.
JACOBS Well, it has deeply uncomfortable resonance right now, but the Moldavian Massacre was the most memorable to me. That was truly scary: terrorists, shattering glass, bloodied bodies. Better make it a martini.
HEALY Gruesome images — and then, cue the credits.
JACOBS It took place during a royal wedding, with the bride, Amanda Carrington, played by real-life royalty, Catherine Oxenberg. Somehow the “Dy” in “Dynasty” was all bound up in my head with Princess Diana, and her own royal wedding to Prince Charles (never mind that the English pronounced it “Din-asty”). Obviously this was a time of conservatism and convention and backlash to the progressivism of the ’60s and ’70s.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
HEALY The depiction of so many women on “Dallas” as sexual objects and playthings definitely ran counter to progressivism. But “Dynasty” and “Dallas” could be topical, too.
JACOBS “Dynasty” moved the national conversation forward on homosexuality. Steven Carrington is immediately introduced as being attracted to men, and despite tentativeness in how the show presented his orientation, one felt the creators were basically on his side — don’t you think? He was a likable and complex character, not a caricature.
Then, of course, Rock Hudson’s death shortly after appearing on the show provoked national hysteria that he might have infected Linda Evans with H.I.V. by kissing her, which led to important education about how the disease is actually transmitted.
It was dismissed for being superficial but was actually right on top of the issues! And it had a few African-American cast members, notably the great Diahann Carroll as the mega-glam Dominique Deveraux. Did “Dallas” have a single minority?
HEALY “Dallas” was an extraordinarily white show. For a state as racially and ethnically diverse as Texas, the series really failed by reducing people of color to servants and waitresses.
It did strive for some social relevancy, though, with its portrait of alcoholism. Sue Ellen struggled for years to get sober and stay sober: J. R. made serenity impossible, but it was really Sue Ellen’s battle with low self-esteem, betrayal, envy and self-loathing that proved painful to watch through her relapses — but ultimately pretty inspiring as she achieved stretches of sobriety.
With the stabs at realism came the fantastical. I speak, of course, about the Mortal Sin of “Dallas” — the entire season of episodes that was retroactively labeled a “dream” of Pam’s to explain Bobby’s death and subsequent reappearance in her shower. What was the best twist of “Dynasty”?
JACOBS I don’t recall anything as shocking as the gasp-inducing “scar” reveal by Marcia Cross on “Melrose Place,” but the return of regular-guy Matthew Blaisdel at the end of Season 7 was certainly unexpected. It was no surprise whatsoever to me, though, at that point, that he had elected to hold the Carrington family hostage.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
And speaking of “Melrose,” that brings us to the current reboot, which stars Grant Show as Blake. How do you think it will stack up against the “Dallas” one a few years ago?
HEALY Watching the new “Dynasty,” I missed the old “Dynasty.” The new versions of both “Dynasty” and “Dallas” go young with their actors. But the “Dallas” reboot still had J. R., Sue Ellen and Bobby, and they were up to their old tricks and in fine form. If only Joan Collins wasreprising her role as Alexis in the “Dynasty” reboot, as a cougar to middle-aged Blake!
JACOBS You keep dreaming, honey … just like Pam Ewing. And now I’ll flounce away, borrowing a line from the original Krystle:
“If you want a rematch, just whistle … if you can!”",1

",Will A Strong Finish/Postseason Keep Kris Bryant As A 2018 1st Round Pick?,"Will A Strong Finish/Postseason Keep Kris Bryant As A 2018 1st Round Pick?
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Kris Bryant was likely a consensus first round pick entering 2017, but he has been somewhat of a disappointment this season. Granted no one is going to really complain about a player hitting .297 with 29 HR, 73 RBI and 110 R through Monday, though those numbers fell short of expectations. A year ago he hit 39 HR with 102 RBI and 121 R, so he’s regressed in all three counting stats.
Is part of the problem spending a lot of time hitting second in the batting order:
Second – 400 AB
Third – 132 AB
Other – 6 AB
It would be an easy thing to point to, but don’t be so quick. In 2016 Bryant actually spent 325 AB hitting second, 239 AB hitting third and 39 AB hitting fifth. The big difference is that Cubs’ leadoff hitters led the league in OBP a year ago, with a .381 OBP. This year they are 17th, at .326, and that means fewer opportunities to drive in runs.
He’s also played a few less games, while his fly ball rate and HR/FB rates have been fairly consistent:
Flyball Rate – 45.8% to 42.3%
HR/FB Rate – 18.8% to 16.3%
His first half marks were closer to his 2016 marks (45.1% and 17.8%, respectively), showing that the same potential pace is there. It would be easy to imagine a return to the 35+ HR range, regardless of what he does from here on out. If he gets hot it would be hard not to anticipate it.
That alone would help him add some RBI, and if the team gets better performances atop the lineup it would look that much better. With the runs scored being there, kicking in a few stolen bases and a vast improvement in his plate discipline (9.8% SwStr% and a 28.0% O-Swing%) the outlook is strong.
He has all the makings of a .300/35/100/100 hitter, and that obviously is a first round pick. Even as things stand now you could make the argument that he belongs in the Top 12, but a strong finish to the season will lock it in. It’s definitely something to watch closely, and we will further analyze it in the offseason, but for now view him as a viable first round option heading into 2018.

",How the Guptas' brand turned toxic in South Africa,"Image copyright Gallo Images Image caption President Zuma's son Duduzane (r) has strong business ties to the Gupta brothers (l)
The reputations of major international firms Bell Pottinger and KPMG have been badly damaged by their work relating to the controversial Gupta family in South Africa. BBC Africa Business Report editor Matthew Davies looks at whether the family's business can survive.
The embattled Gupta family, who own a range of businesses in South Africa, have had all their accounts with a number of banks closed supposedly because of alleged dubious business dealings.
And without banks they cannot pay their staff, which they have put at nearly 8,000.
But how did we get here?
When the Gupta brothers, close friends of President Jacob Zuma, arrived in South Africa as ordinary immigrants from India in the 1990s, they established a computer business Sahara, later going on to buy up stakes in mining and engineering companies, a luxury game lodge, a newspaper and a 24-hour news TV station.
But those very lucrative businesses are now at the heart of their fall from grace in what has been termed ""state capture"" here - allegations that the family, through a slew of corrupt deals, have used their influence to access millions of dollars worth of government contracts.
Image copyright AFP Image caption There have been massive demonstrations against the Guptas
The three brothers, Atul, Rajesh and Ajay have always strenuously denied the allegations.
South Africa's four big banks, ABSA, FNB, Standard and Nedbank told the Guptas in March 2016 that they would no longer provide banking facilities to the Gupta-owned Oakbay company and its subsidiaries.
Some have said the scandal points to a bigger problem for South Africa and its governing African National Congress (ANC).
Questions about wealth
South Africa Communist Party head Blade Nzimande pointed to ""parasitic patronage networks"" in the government. He added that it takes two to tango:
""We can't only blame the Guptas. We must also blame their collaborators inside our movement and government as well‚ and unless we deal with that‚ we are on a slippery slope.""
The principal connection between the brothers and Mr Zuma came through the president's son, Duduzane.
He has worked for the Guptas for 13 years, starting out as a trainee at Sahara Computers.
He recently told the BBC the reason the Guptas chose to go into business with him was that he was a ""likeable guy"".
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Duduzane Zuma denies that his relationship with the Guptas is improper
Corporate documents show that he and the Guptas have served together on at least 11 company boards.
One of President Zuma's wives worked for a Gupta-controlled mining company and his daughter was a director at Sahara Computers.
The family is worth billions of South African rand, and based on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange figures for 2016, Atul Gupta is South Africa's 7th richest person with a net worth of around $770m (£600m).
In recent years, questions have been asked about how one family came to amass such wealth in such a relatively short period of time and the negative attention surrounding the Gupta brand began to make those doing business with them jittery.
The Zumas and the Guptas - 'the Zuptas'
• Bongi Ngema-Zuma, one of the president's wives, used to work for the Gupta-controlled JIC Mining Services as a communications officer
• Duduzile Zuma, his daughter, was a director at Sahara Computers
• Duduzane Zuma, a son, was a director of some Gupta-owned companies but stepped down in 2016 following public pressure
Will 'the Zuptas' fall in South Africa?
The Guptas and their links to Zuma
Jacob Zuma - South Africa's controversial leader
By July, the Guptas were reduced to using just two banks operating inside South Africa, the Bank of China and the Bank of Baroda - both of which have now bailed on them.
There was really only one thing to do: Sell up.
So in August, the family put a ""For Sale"" sign on Oakbay and its other companies.
Within two days, its media assets - the 24-hour news station ANN7 and The New Age newspaper - had gone for a combined $34m to former government spokesperson Mzwanele Manyi, an avid supporter of Mr Zuma.
But this was a vendor-financed deal - essentially with the seller lending the money to the buyer.
The deal was followed with the sale of mining company Tegeta for $228m (£175m) to Charles King.
Charles King is based in Switzerland, and until July had no clear track record in the mining sector. It was registered to trade in fashion.
Leaving South Africa?
The Guptas announced that they would be selling all of their South African assets by the end of the year:
""As a family, we now believe that the time is right for us to exit our shareholding of the South African businesses which we believe will benefit our existing employees,"" they said in a statement.
But how detached the Guptas' business empire becomes from South Africa remains to be seen.
Many observers feel that they will continue, in some fashion, to pull the levers and call the shots.
Again, this is something they and their associates deny.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption President Jacob Zuma has been accused of allowing members of the Indian-born Gupta family to wield undue influence
But back to their undoing.
""There will come a point, however, when they are properly dumped by their backers in the ANC [the Zuma faction] but this is unlikely yet and might only happened closer to 2019,"" says Peter Attard Montalto, an expert on emerging markets.
""We have seen some public distancing of the Zuma faction and the Guptas but behind the scenes, I'm not sure much has changed yet,"" he adds.
Corporate South Africa has been hit by an earthquake because of its links to the family and it will suffer the aftershocks for some time to come.
Several large companies have been shaken to the core and senior staff have resigned or been suspended.
British public relations giant Bell Pottinger is in administration, while international accounting firm KPMG has found itself in the firing line, along with financial consultants McKinsey.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Andrew Harding reports on allegations of high-level corruption in South Africa involving a British PR company
German software company SAP has suspended four of its managers in South Africa while an internal investigation is conducted into alleged kickbacks.
At this stage, the long-term reputational damage to all is hard to gauge.
Having said that, Daniel Silke at Political Futures Consultancy believes the whole saga has actually strengthened the position of South Africa's private sector:
""There are enough top-notch companies who are politically and morally beyond reproach and this is a relatively isolated political incident. The private sector has shown that it can take action quickly.""
What happens next? It's a question many South Africans are asking.
Image copyright PA Image caption Global accountancy firm KPMG removed the leadership team of its South African arm after an internal investigation into work it did for the Gupta family
Opposition politicians and parties are calling for inquiries and investigations.
In the country's parliament, four committees have been ordered to conduct investigations.
Only one has scheduled public meetings so far. The National Prosecuting Authority says its investigations are ongoing, but has been thin on any details.
Chief prosecutor Shaun Abrahams told parliament: ""My silence does not mean that no work is being done.""
As yet, no-one has been arrested or charged in connection with any allegation of corruption linked to the Guptas.
They remain resolute in their denials, saying there are no cases to answer and that they are now in the process of clearing their name ""in the face of unfounded media allegations"".
Whether the Guptas quit South Africa completely is, at this point, a future only known to them.
Selling up completely and moving the proceeds offshore would take some time, even if they wanted to.
Still, their dealings in South Africa have affected a wide range of people, companies and institutions both within and beyond the borders of South Africa.
When this saga is over and the music stops, where everyone will be left standing is a complicated call to make at the moment.
The full picture may take years to emerge.",1

U.S. President Trump said he would be open to bilateral pacts with Canada and Mexico if NAFTA talks fail, Brexit talks continued in Brussels but with little sign of progress and Delta Airlines said it would refuse to pay tariffs on Bombardier’s CSeries jets.
NAFTA
U.S. President Donald Trump said he was open to bilateral trade pacts with either Canada or Mexico if a three-way deal cannot be reached to substantially revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump’s comments came at a White House meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in Washington to promote NAFTA’s benefits as a new round of renegotiations began near Washington.
Business leaders say no NAFTA better than bad deal
Washington
The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to approve $36.5 billion in emergency relief for hurricane-hit areas such as Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as California, struck by devastating wildfires.
Trump finds himself under immense pressure as he considers de-certifying the international nuclear deal with Iran, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility. Trump is expected to unveil a broad strategy on confronting Iran this week. There was always the chance he could still have a last-minute change of heart and certify Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord, which he has called an “embarrassment” and the “worst deal ever negotiated.”
Trump healthcare order could face strong legal objections
Trump told workers that they would win under his tax plan, saying it would help the middle class and boost the economy, though critics say it would mainly benefit corporations and the rich.

In North Korea, thanks to a combination of homemade technology and reverse engineering, the widely-available Computer Numerical Control machine plays a critical role in the weapons programs. They allow Kim Jong Un to build nuclear bombs and missiles without relying as heavily on outside technical aid or imports. Read the report.

Asian stocks reached a 10-year high, riding the bull run in global equity markets, while the dollar sagged after the Federal Reserve showed a more guarded view towards inflation.
Delta Air Lines said it would refuse to pay a 300 percent U.S. tariff on Canadian-built Bombardier CSeries jets, raising doubts about its purchase of 75 of the new aircraft at a list price of more than $5 billion. Delta is the only major U.S. carrier to buy the CSeries so far, and Bastian called the U.S. Commerce Department’s decision to impose anti-dumping duties on the jets “nonsensical.”

","Militants attack east Congo bases, killing two U.N. peacekeepers","GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Militants attacked two military bases in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo on Monday, killing two U.N. peacekeepers and injuring several others, the U.N. mission and the army said.
The mission, known as MONUSCO, said it had deployed attack helicopters in response to the raid, and the army said it was battling militants along the main road leading from North Kivu province’s Beni territory to the Uganda border.
The fighting, which began this weekend, is a fresh outbreak of violence for a region plagued by ethnic tensions and massacres that killed more than 800 people between 2014-2016.
Gunmen believed to belong to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group active near the border, attacked a U.N. peacekeeping base in the village of Mamundioma, over 30 km (20 miles) northeast of Beni, MONUSCO said in a statement.
“This region has seen more than enough violence already,” mission chief Maman Sidikou said. “I reiterate to all these armed groups who continue to threaten and kill civilians, MONUSCO will respond, and it will respond strongly.”
Army spokesman Mak Hazukay said the attacks were carried out simultaneously and hit a U.N. base housing Tanzanian peacekeepers who formed part of an intervention brigade which has a mandate to conduct offensive operations against militants.
Hazukay said later that U.N. helicopters were shelling rebel positions inside Virunga National Park as Congolese troops fought to recover a stretch of road from the rebels.
ADF is believed by authorities to have ambushed and killed many civilians nearby this weekend after a lull in attacks against civilians near Beni this year.
Omar Kavota, who leads an organization that monitors violence in North Kivu, said ADF fighters killed at least three civilians on Saturday by slitting their throats and took another 19 hostages. MONUSCO said that according to initial reports, up to 20 civilians were killed.
Congolese authorities have blamed the ADF for nearly all the massacres between 2014-2016. However, independent and U.N. experts say several armed groups as well as national army commanders have been involved.

",'Hair' gets a little new styling for the age of Trump,"LONDON (Reuters) - A special production of the 1960s rock musical “Hair”, tweaked for the age of Trump, premieres in London this week to mark the ground-breaking show’s 50th anniversary.
The show, staged in London’s Vaults theater, features updates to the dialogue and song lyrics written by James Rado, who wrote the show with Germoe Ragni in the 1960s, to comment on contemporary politics.
Among the updates, characters sing about making “America stronger,” - a reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan. The new production also features new scenes and other dialogue.
“I think what Jim (Rado) wanted to do was just make it a little bit more apparent and clear that America and other Western countries, including Britain, haven’t necessarily moved forward as quickly as we’d hoped,” director Jonathan O‘Boyle, told Reuters.
“Hair” follows the fortunes of The Tribe - a group of hippies fighting conscription into the Vietnam war in 1960s New York.
Cast members perform during a rehearsal of Hair at The Vaults theatre in London, Britain, October 10, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay
It was highly controversial upon its first release for its full-frontal nudity, liberal depiction of drug taking and irreverent treatment of the American flag, which was displayed up-side down and laid on the floor.
The show had lengthy runs on Broadway and on London’s West End, and songs like “Aquarius” and “Good Morning Starshine” helped the original Broadway cast recording sell almost three million copies.

Despite the social and political changes since the show’s creation, its themes of racism, fears of nuclear war - and it’s irreverent treatment of the American flag - mean that is still relevant to the current political discussion.
“Everything that hippies were fighting for then, is still needing to be fought for today,” said Andy Coxon, who plays hippy George Berger. “You’d be surprised how much things haven’t changed. A lot has, we still have a way to go.”
And would the U.S. president himself, currently embroiled in a row over American football players kneeling during the playing of the national anthem in protest, approve of the show?
“He’d probably hate it,” said O‘Boyle.",1

There is no way Antonio Brown is going to benched in any league this week. That said he is not going to be someone I target in DFS, and Brown is also not deserving of the top spot in these rankings. Last week didn’t go according to plan and his displeasure was quite evident on the sideline. Brown caught just four passes for 34 yards last week as Le’Veon Bell was the focus of Pittsburgh’s offensive game plan. Despite the fact that Brown is second in the NFL in targets and has two games of 100-plus yards, I would expect to see that continue this week. Jacksonville has the toughest defense in the league against opposing wide receivers, and Jalen Ramsey appears to be a formidable foe. With 388 yards so far this season, this likely represents the lowest Brown’s value will be.
This week I would look for Pierre Garcon to continue on his pace of alternating good games with duds. Matched up against Patrick Peterson last week Garcon caught four passes (on eight targets) for 36 yards. In the two games where San Francisco’s new receiver has been successful he has 13 catches for 223 yards compared to seven receptions for 62 yards in his other two games. Garcon is still looking for his first touchdown of the season, and there is a good chance it comes this week against the Colts and their lackluster passing defense.
Tampa Bay has just three games under their belt and DeSean Jackson is still looking to firm up his chemistry with Jameis Winston. Last week the growing pains were evident on the sideline, but two weeks ago Jackson did have four catches for 84 yards and a touchdown against the Vikings. Jackson’s lack of success isn’t for a lack of trying (Winston has targeted him 20 times in three games), but he has just nine receptions all year. The Patriots pass defense has left a lot to be desired so far this season, but if anything they will work to take away Tampa’s best weapon; Mike Evans. That could leave some room to operate downfield for Jackson. While I still have Evans ranked ahead of Jackson, the big play threat is nice boom or bust play who we know will be targeted.
While the Chargers have yet to win a game this season, Keenan Allen hasn’t been at fault. He has stayed healthy and last week caught nine passes for 138 yards while showing an impressive burst downfield. Not only has he been a PPR monster with a minimum of five catches each week, he has also showed damage after the catch. The Giants defense has struggled so far, but Janoris Jenkins is still a force to be reckoned with against the other team’s top receiver. Since Allen plays in the slot it is likely that Tyrell Williams will have to deal with Jenkins.
Will Fuller wasted no time jumping right back into the swing of things last week as he found the end zone twice after missing the first three games. Despite having limited practice time Fuller showed some chemistry with Deshaun Watson as the two have spent time working together. Watson appears to be coming into his own as a passer, but the sample size is still small and he is a rookie quarterback. With that being said, it was a good sign to see Fuller involved in his first game of the season as he caught four passes for 32 yards on six targets.
It sounds crazy to say, but in his third NFL season Devin Funchess eclipsed four receptions for just the second time in his career. Perhaps he is finally coming into his own, as he caught seven of his nine targets for 70 yards and two touchdowns. They were the first two touchdowns of the season who finally took advantage of Greg Olson being sidelined. That came after he caught four passes in each of his two previous games for 68 and 58 yards, respectively. With Kelvin Benjamin likely having to deal with Darius Slay this week, that should open some room to work for Funchess.

http://dailybuzzlive.com/2000-simpsons-predicted-donald-trump-presidency/,In 2000 The Simpsons Predicted The Donald Trump Presidency,"I came across this video and I have to say I’m pretty mind blown.
 
I had to watch it a few times, because I could not believe the identical movements as well as the people’s behavior in the background of the cartoon and the actual video of Donald Trump in 2015.
 
For instance, when you watch the cartoon keep your eye on the man holding the sign that says “vote” at the top of the railing. You will see the sign drops to the ground.
 
When you watch the actual video of Donald Trump coming down the escalator, look in the same location of the railing and you will see a sign dropped to the floor.
 
Also, when Donald Trump comes down the escalator in the cartoon he waves and gives a thumbs up. In the actual video of Donald Trump coming down the escalator, 15 years later, he does the same exact thing.
 
You will even see that his election signage is the exact same as the Simpsons cartoon in the year 2000. I mean really… did Donald Trump get together with the Simpsons just to screw with us? Or is this just some kind of weird sh*t no one can explain?

",Vivendi offers compensation to settle dispute with Mediaset: sources,"FILE PHOTO: The Vivendi logo at the company's headquarters in Paris, France, March 10, 2016. REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo
MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - French media group Vivendi has offered to pay compensation to Mediaset to settle a dispute with the Italian broadcaster over a soured pay-TV deal, three sources close to the matter said on Tuesday.
The two companies have been at loggerheads since July last year when Vivendi, in an unexpected U-turn, pulled out of a 800 million euro ($945 million) contract that would have given it full control of Mediaset’s pay-TV arm Premium, saying the unit’s business plan was unrealistic.
One of the sources said Vivendi would pay a first tranche of 250 million euros as part of a wider tentative agreement. The person said more money would be paid at a later stage, but did not quantify the amounts.
One of the other two sources said Mediaset could join a joint venture being set up between Vivendi’s own pay-TV arm Canal+ and Italian phone group Telecom Italia.
Vivendi is the biggest shareholder in Telecom Italia with a 24 percent stake.
This source said it was too early to say whether the two sides would eventually reach a compromise.
“There is a long list of problems to solve,” the person said.
Mediaset, Vivendi and Telecom Italia declined to comment.
Bloomberg reported earlier on Tuesday that Vivendi was considering making a cash and stock offer to settle the dispute as part of a compensation package that may be valued around 1 billion euros, pushing Mediaset shares up more than 5 percent. The stock closed up 1.8 percent.
The sources refused to comment on the size of an eventual settlement. Mediaset and top shareholder Fininvest, the holding company of the family of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, have asked for damages totaling 3 billion euros.
Since the dispute first broke out, the two companies have been trading blows, launching legal action and raising alarm bells in Rome, where politicians have already been growing increasingly wary of French influence over corporate Italy.
Mediaset said in April it would have broken even last year had it not been for the failed sale of its pay-TV arm.
The spat was aggravated in December when Vivendi bought shares to become the second largest shareholder in the Milan-based TV group after Berlusconi’s family. The French company has repeatedly said the move was not hostile but a sign of long-term interest.",1

LONDON (Reuters) - Workers at Bombardier’s Northern Irish plant called on British Prime Minister Theresa May to be more visible in her attempts to save their jobs after the United States imposed tariffs on planes made by the Canadian aerospace firm.
The United States has backed a complaint brought by Boeing (BA.N) that Bombardier (BBDb.TO) received illegal subsidies and dumped planes at “absurdly low” prices, imposing duties of nearly 300 percent on its C-series aircraft.
Britain is confident that it can successfully fight the ruling, which jeopardizes some 4,200 jobs in Northern Ireland, where it is the biggest manufacturing employer.
“We do feel that the levies that are put on are unfair and will be detrimental to jobs in Northern Ireland,” Ron McDowell, 42, who has been an aerospace fitter for 25 years, told Reuters outside parliament in London, where workers had gathered for a protest.
“What we want is for Theresa May to come out publicly rather than speaking behind closed doors.”
McDowell was one of around 20 protesters who stood behind a sign saying “Back Bombardier: Defend our jobs, skills and communities.”

May and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed Bombardier in a call on Tuesday, after business secretary Greg Clark outlined to lawmakers the government’s case against the suit.
Britain and the trade union Unite argue that Boeing’s case is without merit because it does not make a plane comparable to Bombardier’s C-series.

May has emphasized the strength of Britain’s alliance with the United States since Trump came to power as it prepares to leave the European Union, its biggest trading partner.
However, Jimmy Kelly of the Unite union said the dispute emphasized how Trump’s protectionist policies might undermine May’s hopes for a good trading relationship.
“I just don’t fall for Theresa May saying ‘well I’ve contacted Donald Trump’ and ‘I’ve phoned Donald Trump’. He’s parroting ‘USA, USA, USA’. And post-Brexit, why would he be changing his tune?” he said.
“So I think it’s dismal days for UK workers if this is the indicator.”",1
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/technology/driverless-cars-testing.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology,Where Driverless Cars Brake for Golf Carts,"In the Villages, there are 15 miles of roads where autonomous vehicles can learn how to navigate other cars, pedestrians, golf carts, animals, roundabouts and many other obstacles.
The speed limit, just 25 miles an hour, helps reduce the risk if something goes wrong. And because it is private property, the company does not have to share ride information with regulators and it can try new ideas without as much red tape.
Cars that can drive themselves could be a great benefit to older people. Residents at the Villages say that once people stop driving, they often pull back from activities and interacting with friends.
Ms. Jackson, who has lived here for three decades, was one of Voyage’s first test passengers. For now, the company is limiting rides in two driverless cars (with a third arriving in two weeks) to a busy, two-mile loop. A person stays in the driver’s seat in case something goes awry. And the plan is for any Village resident to be able to summon one of Voyage’s cars through a smartphone app for free door-to-door service.
Voyage’s introduction to the Villages comes as self-driving vehicles interact more and more with regular cars. Waymo, the driverless car unit of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, started a trial ride-hailing program in Phoenix this year with several hundred cars. The ride-hailing service Uber is also testing the technology in more than 200 cars with real passengers in Arizona and Pittsburgh.

Voyage was formed this year after spinning out of the online education start-up Udacity. How an online education start-up ended up operating an autonomous taxi service in a retirement community is an “only in Silicon Valley” story.
It started with a drive from nearby Mountain View to San Francisco. When Udacity started to offer a self-driving car curriculum, a team of employees created a challenge for themselves: Make a 32-mile drive on busy El Camino Real during rush hour and without human intervention.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
After five months of failure, the team finally completed the route. Sensing an opportunity, Udacity executives spun out the self-driving car project into a new company. Voyage raised $5.6 million from investors.
The company had a major selling point: Udacity’s chairman, Sebastian Thrun, the founder of Google’s driverless car project and a pioneer in autonomous vehicle research, was joining Voyage as chairman. He pushed the idea of starting in a retirement community.
It was a good match. Last year, the Villages had conducted a survey about what amenities residents wanted to see over the next 15 years. Among the top answers: autonomous cars and a shuttle service.
Four years ago, the Villages considered a shuttle, but decided it was too costly to have a full-time driver. There is a service called the Villages Medical Auxiliary to take people to the doctor’s office or the supermarket, but there is a shortage of volunteer drivers and people need to make appointments two days in advance. It pushes residents to keep driving when they shouldn’t.
Ask almost anyone at the Villages and he or she can tell you about an accident: the driver who drove into a pond or the person who hit the accelerator instead of the brake and took out the tennis court fence.

“The driverless car would be far less risky than the drivers that we currently have,” said Bill Devincenzi, a former board president of the Villages whose term expired in June.
Another issue that could be solved by driverless cars is a shortage of parking spots. Like many of the Villages’ residents, Nancy Green, 88, is active. She swims three times a week, regularly attends wine-tasting dinners and participates in a weekly bridge game. But after three back operations, she struggles to walk long distances.
For popular events, she sometimes arrives an hour early to secure one of the few handicap spots. If none are available, she turns around and goes home. She said she did not like eating dinner at the clubhouse at 5:30 p.m., but the chances of finding a parking spot at her preferred time of 7 p.m. were “slim and none.”
“From that perspective, I think the self-driving car would be great,” she said.
But what seemed like a done deal hit a roadblock this year. The agreement to offer self-driving car rides in the retirement community almost fell apart when negotiations hit an impasse over insurance. California requires autonomous vehicles to have $5 million of coverage, but the Villages insisted on 50 percent more coverage because it is a private community with more liability risk.

“We’d call the Geicos and Progressives of the world and asked them, ‘Do you do self-driving car insurance?’” said Oliver Cameron, Voyage’s 29-year-old chief executive. “The answer was no.”

Working with an insurance broker, Voyage delved into “exotic insurance” policies and had to pay twice as much per car for its insurance policy versus the standard $5 million coverage.
The insurer, Munich Re, also had an unusual request. It wanted data — any data — produced by the cars. Because this is a new field, even insurers wanted to understand the potential risks of self-driving cars. Voyage agreed to hand over nonidentifiable, sensor data.
Another issue arose when Mr. Thrun had to leave the company because of a conflict of interest. He was also the chief executive of Kitty Hawk, a flying car start-up backed by Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, which owns Waymo.
Coupled with the fact that Voyage and not Udacity would be operating in the Villages, some in the community were concerned that they had fallen for a bait and switch.
To sweeten the deal for the Villages, Voyage offered them an equity stake — the equivalent of what it would grant a new hire.
For the last few months, Voyage has been testing at the Villages. The cars — nicknamed Homer and Marge after the characters on “The Simpsons” — have often prompted questions from curious onlookers in the Villages.
Are you from Google? (No.)
What’s that spinning top on the roof? (It’s a sensor that helps the car see the world around it.)

How do I invest? (Flattering, but we’re not taking new investors now.)
Then, there were the skeptics who questioned whether driverless cars were safer. Mr. Cameron said the residents’ concerns were a welcome reality check from the hype of Silicon Valley. “It’s preparing us for the sorts of questions many millions have on their mind when it comes to the technology,” he said.
Ms. Jackson, who still drives regularly and shuttles friends to church, activities and other community events, said she could not distinguish between human driver and machine during her ride.
“I thought it was great,” she said. “I wasn’t fearful.”",1

","It’s Yankees vs. Indians, and Chapman vs. His Memories","With a Yankee bullpen that now seems taxed — David Robertson and Chad Green have not looked the same since their long stints in the wild-card playoff game last week and Dellin Betances has been erratic — Manager Joe Girardi said he was ready to count on Chapman for two innings on Wednesday night, something he did just once during the regular season.
Chapman will not be the only one forced to confront his past when Game 5 begins. The Indians, too, are dealing with the fact that they are back to a similar point they were a year ago.
In the 2016 World Series, the Indians had a three-games-to-one lead over the Cubs and three chances to finish them off, including a deciding game in their home park. They couldn’t do it.
Against the Yankees, the Indians had a 2-0 lead in this series and failed in their first two chances to close out the series. Their third, and final, chance will come at home.
Photo
Indians Manager Terry Francona, who managed the Boston Red Sox when they staged an epic comeback from a 3-0 deficit against the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series, pointed to the capricious nature of these series and the fine margin between winning and losing.
“There’s a lot going on in between that I think people lose sight of,” Francona said. “I don’t think you’re just either dumb or smart, or good or bad. Sometimes there’s some gray there.”
The same could be said for Chapman.
There has existed, throughout a major league career that began in 2010, an air of imperviousness about him. It is owed not just to a fastball that once touched 105 miles per hour, but also to his chiseled, athletic frame and his dispassionate demeanor on the mound, with a smile that more closely resembles a sneer. Never did he evoke a sense of vulnerability.

If Game 7 of the 2016 Series opened a hole in that armor, so, too, has this season.
It began with Chapman coming back to the Yankees after signing a five-year, $86 million free-agent contract last December, the longest and most lucrative ever for a reliever. But in May, Chapman went to the disabled list for a month with a sore shoulder and in August he struggled so severely that he lost his role as closer.

Many eyes were on Chapman when the Yankees demoted him, but Chapman did not complain. At pitching coach Larry Rothschild’s suggestion, he widened the grip on his fastball, sacrificing movement for command, and began to work his way back to form.
Since returning to the closer’s role in early September, Chapman has not allowed a run in 14⅔ innings, including the postseason. The Indians, though, have challenged him. Jason Kipnis and Jose Ramirez singled off him in the ninth inning of Game 3, with the Yankees holding on to a 1-0 lead. Carlos Santana then drove a 3-2 fastball just short of the warning track in left field for the final out.
The Indians forced Chapman to throw 26 pitches in that inning — 23 of which were fastballs that were 100 m.p.h. or faster.
“It’s a different at-bat than you’ll see versus most pitchers,” Kipnis said before Game 4. “You just have to pay attention to what he’s trying to do that night. Is he in love with his fastball because it’s hitting 103, or is he trying to establish a little bit of a slider?”
He added: “You watch what he’s doing and he’s not just a guy that you literally take any direction with. You don’t try to pull. You don’t try to spray. You literally just try to see the ball over the plate and get the barrel to it.”
Often lost in last year’s Game 7 is that Chapman — who had little life left on his fastball after throwing 42 pitches in Game 5 for the Cubs and another 20 in Game 6 — set the Indians down in order in the ninth inning with the score tied. In that instance, he leaned heavily on his slider and changeup. Then the rains came, allowing the Cubs to regroup, and Heyward to make his impassioned speech. Chicago won the title in the 10th.
Many things will have to go right for the Yankees on Wednesday night, beginning with solving what promises to be a much sharper Corey Kluber. Aaron Judge, who has struck out 12 times in 15 at-bats in this series, may need to get a big hit with the game on the line. But if the Yankees are in a position to cap their comeback, it is hard to imagine a scenario where Chapman isn’t standing on the mound at the end, trying to finish off the Indians — and his own ghosts.",1

",Harvey Weinstein Rebuked by Cannes and Bafta Over Sexual Abuse Scandal,"The Times revealed that he had paid off accusers for decades, and several women interviewed by The New Yorker accused him of rape. The women’s accounts are broadly similar: They said Mr. Weinstein would invite them to meetings in offices or hotel rooms, where he would appear naked or in a bathrobe, asking them to exchange massages, have sex or watch him masturbate.
On Sunday, after a third of the all-male board of his namesake production company resigned, Mr. Weinstein was fired.
But anger has continued to spread as new accusations emerge and some of the women affected, such as the American actress Rose McGowan, have slammed the industry for being slow to condemn him and accused his peers of keeping what had long been an open secret.
Members of Britain’s Parliament
On Wednesday, Chi Onwurah, a Labour Party member of the British Parliament, and other politicians signed an open letter demanding that Prime Minister Theresa May revoke Mr. Weinstein’s 2004 title, Commander of the Order of the British Empire.
The status, ranked beneath a knighthood, recognizes achievement in the arts and sciences.
“His continued membership runs the risk of bringing the honors system into disrepute and, moreover, sending the deeply troubling signal that our government does not take women’s voices or allegations of sexual harassment seriously,” the letter said.
It is unclear whether the title will be revisited. A spokeswoman for Britain’s Cabinet Office, which awards the honors, said it did not comment on whether a person’s title was being reconsidered unless it was revoked in a process called “forfeiture.”
A title may be revoked, according to the Cabinet Office, if its holder is “sentenced to prison for at least three months for a criminal offense” or “censured or struck off by a professional or regulatory body for something directly relevant to their honor.”

A Bafta Rebuke
The British Academy of Film and Television Arts, which hosts the prestigious annual EE British Academy Film Awards, or Baftas, in London, said Mr. Weinstein’s suspension was effective immediately.
The group said in a statement that it had “previously been a beneficiary of Mr. Weinstein’s support for its charitable work,” including scholarships to support emerging artists, but “considers the reported alleged behavior completely unacceptable and incompatible with BAFTA’s values.”
“We hope this announcement sends a clear message that such behavior has absolutely no place in our industry,” the group said.

Cannes Statement
The Cannes Film Festival released a statement, signed by the festival’s presidents, Pierre Lescure and Thierry Frémaux, that said they were “dismayed to learn of the accusations of harassment and sexual violence recently leveled against Harvey Weinstein.”
“These actions point to a pattern of behavior that merits only the clearest and most unequivocal condemnations,” the statement said. “Our thoughts go to the victims.”

More Accusations
Since the original Times investigation was published, more women have accused Mr. Weinstein of inappropriate behavior, including the actresses Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow.
On Wednesday, the British model and actress Cara Delevingne posted a written account of her experience with Mr. Weinstein. She said that early in her career, she met the producer in his hotel room, where she found him with another woman.
“He asked us to kiss,” Ms. Delevingne wrote, adding that she had quickly got up and tried to leave. “He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips,” she said, describing feelings of guilt because she later secured a part in one of his films.
The French actress Léa Seydoux, who won a Palme d’Or at Cannes for “Blue Is the Warmest Color,” said Mr. Weinstein invited her to the Hôtel Plaza Athénée around 2012 for a drink and to talk about her career, but she had to fight him off.

“We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me,” she wrote in The Guardian. “I had to defend myself. He’s big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him. I left his room, thoroughly disgusted.”
On Tuesday, the British actress Romola Garai told The Guardian that Mr. Weinstein had sexually harassed her in his room at The Savoy in London when she was 18. She said she had gone for a meeting and found him wearing only a bathrobe.
“I felt violated by it; it has stayed very clearly in my memory,” she said.
Ms. Argento, the Italian actress and director, told The New Yorker that Mr. Weinstein had forcibly performed oral sex on her in 1997 in a room at the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc when she was 21. “It wouldn’t stop,” she said. “It was a nightmare.”
Ms. Godrèche, the French actress, told The Times that Mr. Weinstein abused her at the same hotel in 1996, when she was 24. “I was so naïve and unprepared,” she said.
Ms. Gutierrez told The New Yorker that Mr. Weinstein groped her breasts when he met with her in 2015, and that she went to the police. A sting operation captured audio of Mr. Weinstein repeatedly telling her to go with him into his hotel room.
Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said in a statement on Tuesday that “any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.”
“Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances,” Ms. Hofmeister added. “He will not be available for further comments, as he is taking the time to focus on his family, on getting counseling and rebuilding his life.”
Some actors have spoken out in support of the women. Colin Firth, the British star of “The King’s Speech,” a Weinstein film, said in a statement that Mr. Weinstein “was a powerful and frightening man to stand up to,” and Mr. Firth said he applauded the women’s courage.
Benedict Cumberbatch, the British actor whose film “The Current War” was produced by the Weinstein Company, said in a statement that he was “utterly disgusted by the continuing revelations of Harvey Weinstein’s horrifying and unforgivable actions.” Addressing the women, Mr. Cumberbatch said: “We hear you and believe you.”

","'Blade Runner,' 'Westworld' test our empathy","(CNN) The following contains major spoilers about ""Blade Runner 2049.""
Like HBO's ""Westworld,"" ""Blade Runner 2049"" tinkered with the DNA of the original movie in reimagining it for the 21st century. In both, the formula includes asking an audience to empathize with artificial intelligence, at a time when such compassion -- even toward fellow citizens with opposing viewpoints -- is often in short supply.
""Westworld"" toyed with expectations by essentially flipping the script. Set in an elaborate amusement park for adults, the series departed from Michael Crichton's original -- where the robots went wild and began killing guests -- to probe the dawning sentience of those creations. Suddenly, the people mistreating them were the bad guys, even if the androids could be rebooted after each sordid encounter.
""Blade Runner"" adopts a similar approach. Its central character, K, played by Ryan Gosling, is a replicant, one charged with hunting down his misbehaving brethren.
Ridley Scott's first film also showed sympathy for these constructs, and there's still debate about the true nature of Harrison Ford's character. In the new plot, K hopes that he might be special in a way that evokes ""Pinocchio,"" as did another movie about a not-quite-real boy, Steven Spielberg's ""A.I.""

",Man of the hour Thomas eyes 'threepeat' in Malaysia,"Sep 30, 2017; Jersey City, NJ, USA; Justin Thomas hits a shot out of the sand on the fourth hole during the third round foursomes matches of The President's Cup golf tournament at Liberty National Golf Course. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Only weeks after capping his brilliant season with the $10 million bonus as FedExCup champion, Justin Thomas heads back to his happy hunting ground at the CIMB Classic, seeking a ‘threepeat’ of titles in Malaysia.
Much has changed for 24-year-old Thomas since his last trip to TPC Kuala Lumpur, when he was still an unproven, if highly regarded, talent coming off his rookie season.
A three-stroke win to defend his championship underlined his pedigree, however, and was the springboard for a stellar campaign featuring five wins, a maiden major title and last month’s FedExCup triumph.
Once known as “Jordan Spieth’s friend”, the Louisville, Kentucky-born golfer returns to Southeast Asia as the PGA Tour’s player of the year and in the wake of an impressive debut for the United States in their dominant Presidents Cup win.
Repeating his 2016-17 heroics will be a stiff challenge but the co-sanctioned CIMB Classic could offer the perfect platform for another productive season for the world number four.
That is, of course, if fatigue can be kept at bay.
Thomas has barely had time to pause for breath after a frenetic finish to the campaign and will take a proper break only after playing next week’s CJ Cup, South Korea’s first PGA Tour-sanctioned event.
“It’s going to be a little bit different this year, just in terms of everything that’s happened and kind of the lack of preparation I’ll probably get as opposed to years prior,” Thomas said last week.
Thomas will also be up against a quality field at the PGA Tour’s second event in the 2017-18 calendar, including Japan’s world number three Hideki Matsuyama, who he pipped for the circuit’s player of the year award.
Twenty-five-year-old Matsuyama, another sparkling young talent, was runner-up behind Thomas in Malaysia last year in a breakout season boasting three wins and two top-five finishes at the majors.
Like most of his International team mates, he had a forgettable Presidents Cup, however, and was unwell upon returning to Japan.
“I just took the week off. Today’s round was really the first time I’ve picked up a club since the Presidents Cup, but hopefully I can find my game quickly and somehow make it interesting on Sunday,” he said at TPC Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday.
Apart from Thomas, eight other major winners are in the restricted field of 78 at the $7 million tournament, including Americans Keegan Bradley, Stewart Cink and Jason Dufner, and a trio of South Africans in Ernie Els, Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel.",1

","Media Pushes Narrative Vegas Gunman ‘Loved Conspiracy Theories’, Questioned 9","By Matt Agorist
As police frantically continue to find a motive for the Las Vegas murderer, both sides of the political spectrum — equally as frantic — search for anything that ties him to their political foes. Now it appears that there is a new narrative surfacing from multiple outlets that Stephen Paddock was a conspiracy theorist who thought 9/11 was an inside job.
Rest assured, if police had any evidence linking this murderous psychopath to an extreme right, extreme left, or terrorist group, this would’ve been made public by now. We have seen an unprecedented length of time go by, not only without surveillance footage but with no hints as to why Paddock shot into a crowd of 22,000 innocent people. However, it looks like this may start to change.
According to the Daily Mail, a prostitute who Paddock hired repeatedly has allegedly come forward with some rather nefarious claims.
A Las Vegas prostitute who was hired by murderer Stephen Paddock has spoken out about their ‘violent’ sex sessions and how he bragged about having ‘bad blood’. The woman, who spoke anonymously, said she would spend hours drinking and gambling in Sin City with Paddock, who she described as ‘paranoid’ and ‘obsessive’. If he hit a winning streak, he would take her back to his room for ‘really aggressive and violent sex’ including living out rape fantasies, she said.
While violent rape fantasies from a mass murderer surely fit the bill, the idea that questioning the official government story on 9/11 is somehow an indication that someone may go on a killing spree is as asinine as it is dangerous. However, this is what’s happening right now in the media.
The 27-year-old woman said Paddock, 64, would often rant about conspiracy theories including how 9/11 was orchestrated by the US government.
After failing to tie Paddock to the left, right, and ISIS, the media is now reaching out to tie him to those who question the government.
It is important to note that most people who question the State do so out of a desire to prevent death, not foster it. People who questioned the narrative of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq did so because they wanted to prevent a war in which many would die. However, they were labeled as kooks and conspiracy theorists by the establishment—despite being proven right years later.
This is nothing new.
In fact, in spite having no real reason to go after ‘conspiracy theorists’, the government has a long history of infiltrating groups and labeling those who question the status quo as a threat. It even has a name: PATCON, short for “Patriot Conspiracy.”
Indeed, much of the police state which has risen up around the country is in response to the essentially non-existent threat from those who want to expose the crimes of the State who are labeled as extremist groups. YouTube and Google have even gotten in on the action and have moved to censor evidence of US war crimes and historical footage of war.
A police sergeant in Morgan County, Indiana admitted in May of 2014 that his department had obtained an armored vehicle in part because of returning military veterans were deemed domestic terror threats by Homeland Security in 2009.
In August of 2013, Concord, New Hampshire Police Chief John Duval secretly contacted Homeland Security and demanded an armored vehicle due to the alleged “threat” posed by peaceful libertarians.
The MIAC Report, a federal training document famously presented to Missouri police in 2009, went as far as falsely tying supporters of former Presidential Candidate Ron Paul and the Constitution to “extremist groups” as well.
In 2014, a sheriff’s deputy admitted on video that these weapons of war were needed to fend off “constitutionalists” with firearms.
The important thing to remember is that no matter which group — outside of ISIS who openly calls for killing — that the investigation attempts to associate with Paddock is not full of mass murderers.
Naturally, both sides of the political spectrum are hoping for Stephen Paddock to identify with their rival party. That way they can use the logical fallacy of false equivalence to paint their political enemies as mass murderers.
In fact, however, it is entirely possible that perhaps one of the reasons police are taking so long to release a motive—is that he didn’t have one. Perhaps, Paddock snapped and simply went on a killing spree because he is insane.
As the Free Thought Project reported last week, it was revealed that Paddock was prescribed psychotropic drugs which can cause people to be violent.
This information was given to the Las Vegas Review-Journal by a source within law enforcement who was not authorized to speak publicly about this case.
As the Journal reports:
Records from the Nevada Prescription Monitoring Program obtained Tuesday show Paddock was prescribed 50 10-milligram diazepam tablets by Henderson physician Dr. Steven Winkler on June 21. A woman who answered the phone at Winkler’s office would not make him available to answer questions and would neither confirm nor deny that Paddock was ever a patient. Paddock purchased the drug — its brand name is Valium — without insurance at a Walgreens store in Reno on the same day it was prescribed. He was supposed to take one pill a day.
Valium, although often used as a sedative and calming medication, can have serious side effects of aggression. According to the FDA, diazepam can elicit the following side effects:
confusion, hallucinations, unusual thoughts or behavior;
unusual risk-taking behavior, decreased inhibitions, no fear of danger;
depressed mood, thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself;
hyperactivity, agitation, aggression, hostility;
“If somebody has an underlying aggression problem and you sedate them with that drug, they can become aggressive,” said Dr. Mel Pohl, chief medical officer of the Las Vegas Recovery Center. “It can disinhibit an underlying emotional state. … It is much like what happens when you give alcohol to some people … they become aggressive instead of going to sleep.”
TFTP even interviewed a Harvard educated psychiatrist who backed up the claim that Paddock may have been on harder psychotropic drugs as well. Why isn’t the media calling for an investigation into these things?
No matter how people try and spin this mass murder to fit their agenda, the fact remains that there are likely thousands of people, if not more, mourning the loss of family members and friends killed in Las Vegas on Sunday. No amount of spin, political shaming, or wrongful association will change that.

It’s called “Game of 72” or “72 Hour Challenge” and it’s leaving parents terrified, not knowing where their children are.
 
It dares children to disappear without telling friends or family where they are at, for up to 72 hours.
 
Authorities were alerted to the game after a 13-year-old girl went missing for three days.
 
After being gone for 72 hours, the girl only known as ‘Emma’, finally turned up safe and well at her family’s home over the weekend.
 
‘Emma’ then refused to tell police or her parents where she had been, but only said that she had completed the ‘Game of 72′ dare.
 
This ’72 Hour Challenge’ is causing quite a stir among police stations across the world. So far, authorities say, dozens of panicked Facebook post are being shared by parents, warning each other about the game.
 
The advocacy group, Against Dangerous Games for Children, said: “We urge all parents to be aware their children might be involved in this game. Children must be told it is much better to fail the game, then risk a dangerous situation and never come home at all.”

",China congress: Military facelift a sign of bigger changes,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The People's Liberation Army has seen profound changes
Of the many noteworthy developments that have characterised Chinese President Xi Jinping's first five-year term, none stands out as much as military reform, and this reveals a great deal about the coming political trajectory in China, writes political analyst Cheng Li.
Xi Jinping did not shy from the bold and broad undertaking of military reform and it has resulted in profound changes to the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
Even beyond the monumental purges of top generals, whose shameless corruption extended to practices like selling military titles, Mr Xi has worked with single-minded purpose to organise and modernise China's military.
His efforts have centred on marginalising the four so-called ""general departments"" of the PLA that functioned as a virtual arm of government and had undermined the authority of the civilian-led Central Military Commission (CMC).
He also transformed China's military operations from a Russian-style, army-centric system toward what analysts call a ""Western-style joint command""; and swiftly promoted ""young guards"" to top positions in the officer corps.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In addition to being president, Mr Xi is also the commander in chief of China's military
It will take years to fully assess the impact of these reforms. But further changes appear to be in the works.
Judging from the list of military and police delegates to the forthcoming congress where China's future leaders are to be unveiled, the largest turnover of senior officers in the history of the People's Republic of China (PRC) is set to occur.
Shuffling the decks
An extraordinary 90% of the 300 military delegates will be first-time attendees.
At most, only 17% (seven of 41) of the military representatives with full membership on the 18th Central Committee will retain their seats.
This would constitute the largest-ever turnover of military elite in the history of the PRC.
The new top military leadership will most likely consist of Mr Xi's long-time friends Gen Zhang Youxia, Gen Li Zuocheng, and Adm Miao Hua, along with the newly promoted commanders of the PLA army, navy, air force, and strategic support force.
In addition to their perceived loyalty to Xi Jinping, these generals are known for their extended military service, combat experience, and professional knowledge of modern warfare.
Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Gen Li Zuocheng (centre) is known to be a long-time friend of President Xi Jinping
The degree of military reshuffling also offers a clue to broader leadership changes, particularly the likelihood of Mr Xi further consolidating power.
With firm control over the military, Mr Xi has set the stage for a massive turnover in the party leadership at the 19th Party Congress.
Of the 376 members of the 18th Central Committee, 38 (about 10%) have already been purged on corruption charges and other transgressions.
Those purged comprise one Politburo member (former Chongqing party secretary Sun Zhengcai), 19 full members, and 18 alternate members.
In addition, about 200 members (53% of the committee) have either retired or will soon retire and, so will not be considered for the 19th Central Committee.
So the turnover rate between the 18th and 19th Central Committees could be as high as 70%, making it the largest turnover since the 9th Party Congress in 1969 at the peak of the Cultural Revolution.
Factional politics certainly help explain the fall of some prominent officials.
But Mr Xi can also make a strong case that the overall objective of his anti-corruption campaign has been to restore faith in a ruling party that had lost trust among the Chinese public.
Nevertheless, Mr Xi and his strongest political ally, the anti-corruption tsar Wang Qishan, seem to understand that the unprecedentedly widespread campaign has earned them many political enemies.
Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Wang Qishan is one of Mr Xi's closest allies
What began with the military ends with the civilian administration.
The biggest risk for Mr Xi and Mr Wang is that, having purged a large crop of corrupt officials, they have become wary of spending political capital to accelerate institutional reforms.
This may explain why they have striven to win public support and demonstrate that the leadership agenda aligns with the country's best interests.
Just as military reform aimed to assert civilian control over the military and spur its modernisation through initiatives like structural transformation and a strategic overhaul, the upcoming congress will likely pursue some structural changes, which can move toward improving governance.
But what does this mean for the make-up of the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee?
All the President's men
Mr Xi's confidants in the current Politburo - director of the general office of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee Li Zhanshu, and director of the central organisation department Zhao Leji - will most likely enter it.
Protégés from his years in Zhejiang province who were known for their strong support for market reform, namely Chongqing party secretary Chen Min'er, Jiangsu party secretary Li Qiang, and Beijing party secretary Cai Qi, are positioned to obtain seats in the new Politburo - Mr Chen and Li Qiang may even be contenders for the Standing Committee.
Shanghai party secretary Han Zheng and director of the office of the central economic leading group Liu He, two seasoned economic technocrats, are expected to emerge as two of the top economic decision-makers in the national leadership after the congress.
While strong ties to Mr Xi help explain their rapid political career advancement in recent years, a number of civilian leaders, except for Cai Qi, already serve on the Central Committee as full or alternate members.
Institutional norms and regulations, including age requirements, continue to apply to these leaders' expected promotion path.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hu Chunhua is seen as a possible pick for the Standing Committee
A majority of the national leaders after the 19th Party Congress will have been born in the 1950s, just as a majority of the provincial and ministerial leaders will have been born in the 1960s.
It is almost certain that the new Politburo, including the Standing Committee, will consist of a few leaders who are protégés of Mr Xi's predecessors.
Jiang Zemin's confidant Xu Qiliang, who also has a good relationship with Mr Xi, will likely remain as both a Politburo member and vice chairman of the CMC after the 19th Party Congress.
Hu Chunhua, a sixth-generation front-runner and protégé of Hu Jintao, is also a strong contender for the Politburo Standing Committee.
So the biggest question will be whether or not Xi Jinping unites the party establishment by forming a team of rivals and deepening China's political institutionalisation.
Abiding by established rules and norms and respecting the peaceful transition of power all carry profound implications for the future direction of the country.
More than the success or failure of any single campaign or initiative, observers in China and abroad are eager to see how Xi Jinping and his colleagues address this crucial issue in just a few short weeks.
Cheng Li is Director of and Senior Fellow in the John L. Thornton China Center at The Brookings Institution. His latest books include Chinese Politics in the Xi Jinping Era: Reassessing Collective Leadership (2016) and The Power of Ideas: The Rising Influence of Thinkers and Think Tanks in China (2017).",1
"https://www.activistpost.com/2017/09/california-ban-on-diesel-fuel-cars-laying-the-ground-work-to-ban-humans-from-the-road.html
",California Seeks Ban On Fossil Fuel Cars Laying The Groundwork To Ban Humans From The Road,"By Aaron Kesel
California known as the sunny state is eyeing a ban on sales of fossil-fuel cars in hopes of reducing carbon emissions as they seed the deeper agenda to eventually ban humans from driving as we switch to an autonomous lifestyle.
California Gov. Jerry Brown has reportedly “expressed an interest” in the restrictions, according to Bloomberg, which cited California Air Resources Board (CARB) chair, Mary Nichols.
California may become the first U.S. territory to take action, similar to China, France, and the UK—all of which plan to phase out gas- and diesel-car sales over the next three decades.
“I’ve gotten messages from the Governor asking, ‘Why haven’t we done something already?’” Nichols told the news agency. “The Governor has certainly indicated an interest in why China can do this and not California.”
The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 requires the state to have a sharp reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 in an effort to return to 1990 levels in three years, and drop 80 percent lower by 2050.
To reach these “ambitious” goals, “we have to pretty much replace all combustion with some form of renewable energy,” Nichols told Bloomberg. “We’re looking at that as a method of moving this discussion forward.”
But deep beneath banning internal combustion engines is the ulterior eventual agenda of banning human beings from driving at all, as Yahoo UK proposed last year, because “driverless cars make roads safer by eliminating human error.”
“While humans can become distracted behind the wheel and drive drunk or tired, autonomous cars lack this ability,” the publication wrote. “Long term, these vehicles will drive better than any human possibly can,’” Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at Nvidia Corp told Bloomberg, noting that this technology has “superhuman intelligence.” “We’re not there yet, but we will get there sooner than we believe.”
The main problems besides humans keeping driverless cars off the road is actually federal laws and infrastructure, but that soon may change.
The U.S. government has released policy proposals on driverless cars, meaning that both industry and policy are shifting gear to prepare for the future to remove you from the road.
Two similar bills one by the Senate and one by the House would allow automakers each to operate more self-driving cars per year on U.S. roads if the measures are signed into law. The key difference between the pieces of legislation is that the Senate wants to slowly increase the number of driverless cars on the roads, while the House bill proposes to just put 100,000 self-driving vehicles on the road and hope for the best.
A top Senate Democrat told Politico that “there are a number of differences” between the Senate’s draft and what the House just passed.
The Senate’s self-driving bill would also allow the Secretary of Transportation to grant exemptions to federal motor vehicle rules that require cars to have human operators. Initially, 50,000 cars per automaker could be operated by companies if they can prove they meet existing safety standards. After a year, the number of exemptions per manufacturer would increase to 75,000, and would eventually increase up to 100,000 in the third year.
The House’s bill titled the SELF DRIVE Act (Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research In-Vehicle Evolution) would allow for a speedier deployment of self-driving cars on America’s streets. The SELF DRIVE Act recently passed unanimously earlier this month with overwhelming bipartisan support, Wired reported.
Now the Senate has to pass its own bill. Then both branches will work together to come up with a compromised piece of legislation that will eventually end up on president Donald Trump’s desk to allow driverless cars in all 50 states.
Both versions of legislation prohibit states and other local jurisdictions from adopting regulations related to cars’ design, construction, software or communication. And instead, give that power to regulate the vehicles to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA.)
States would still have authority over vehicle registration, safety inspections, insurance and licensing, under the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV.)
Automakers would be able to apply for exemptions to operate more than 100,000 self-driving cars after five years under the landmark legislation. The current limit for such exemptions to federal auto standards is 2,500 cars for two years at a time.
The Senate held a hearing on September 13 on the deployment of self-driving trucks, Reuters reported.
The final version of the Senate’s drafted bill amended the legislation and removed driverless trucks, Detroit News reported.
“Legislation like the bill introduced today will allow manufacturers to conduct more testing and to safely deploy self-driving vehicles to realize the safety, mobility, congestion, environmental, land-use and other benefits of this transformative technology,” General Motors Co. said in a statement earlier this month.
Twenty-two states have either passed legislation related to autonomous vehicles or adopted regulations through a governor’s executive order. Those include Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, Massachusetts, Nevada, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, according to USA Today.
Meanwhile, in the U.S. and Canada advocates for autonomous vehicles are preparing the final puzzle piece to replace humans the infrastructure and have proposed a shift toward ‘driver-free zones,’ starting by banning human drivers from car-pool lanes on a 150-mile stretch of Interstate 5 between Seattle and Vancouver.
Other consumer advocate groups are worried about the potential risks involved with exempting so many autonomous vehicles from safety standards. The California-based advocate group Consumer Watchdog said in a statement that “The autonomous vehicle bill just passed by the House leaves a wild west without adequate safety protections for consumers.”
We may soon see human driving outlawed in congested city centers like London, on college campuses and at airports, Kristin Schondorf, executive director of automotive transportation at consultant EY told Auto News.
“In city centers, you don’t even want non-automated vehicles; they would just ruin the whole point of why you have a smart city,” Schondorf, a former engineer at Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said. “It makes it a dumb city.”
John Krafcik, head of Google’s self-driving car project, echoed her sentiment stating in an August interview with Bloomberg Businessweek that the tech giant is developing cars without steering wheels and gas or brake pedals adding “we need to take the human out of the loop.”
Ford CEO Mark Fields also feels the same way stating Ford would begin selling robot taxis without any steering wheel or gas and brake pedals by 2021, TechCrunch reported.

",Kyrgios blames stomach bug for Shanghai retirement,"FILE PHOTO: Nick Kyrgios of Australia sits on the bench during a change of ends as he plays against Rafael Nadal of Spain at the Men's Singles Finals, China Open, Beijing, China, October 8, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter
(Reuters) - Nick Kyrgios said a stomach bug and a shoulder problem had forced him to retire after losing the first set in his Shanghai Masters first-round match against American Steve Johnson on Tuesday.
The mercurial Australian, who lost to Rafa Nadal in the China Open final on Sunday, took a 4-2 lead in the tiebreak before Johnson fired a series of winners to take the set 7-6(5).
Kyrgios then ran up to his opponent, shook his hand and walked off court to boos from the crowd, leaving Johnson and chair umpire Fergus Murphy confused.
Local media reported that Kyrgios received two code violations during the set and was docked a point in the tiebreak.
Reports also said he told officials he would quit if he lost the set, but Kyrgios took to Twitter to apologize to his fans.
“I’ve been battling a stomach bug for the past 24 hours and I tried to be ready but I was really struggling on the court today which I think was pretty evident from the first point,” Kyrgios said.
“My shoulder started to hurt in the practice which didn’t help either and once I lost the first set I was just not strong enough to continue because I’ve not eaten much in the past 24 hours,” he added.
”I‘m hoping to be okay for the doubles and will make a decision tomorrow morning, hopefully off of a good night’s sleep which I didn’t get last night.
“I‘m gutted to be honest to be honest as I was keen to keep the good momentum that I built in Beijing going and finish the year strong. I’ll do what I can to make sure I do.”
Kyrgios was fined $16,500 by the ATP last year for deliberately throwing a game away during his second-round defeat by Mischa Zverev in Shanghai.
Argentine Juan Martin del Potro overpowered Russian teenager Andrey Rublev 6-3 6-4 in the second round.

",The Chicago Bears Week Four Observations,"The Chicago Bears Week Four Observations
(Before It's News)
By Bryan Dietzler
After a somewhat successful game against the Pittsburgh Steelers the previous Sunday, the Bears headed north to Lambeau Field to take on the Green Bay Packers. The Packers have had the Bears number for a while, but Chicago has been able to sneak in a win now and then.
I was one of many people who felt that the Bears would make Thursday night’s game against the Packers a close one. You would have thought that with the Packers missing some of their key starters the Bears may have a better chance of not just keeping it close but could win the game. Green Bay had not been playing that well either so it appeared as if Chicago would have a good chance.
At least on paper, it looked like that would happen.
But it didn’t.
In another weird game, the Bears struggled to get anything going while the Packers looked like world beaters.
Chicago lost to Green Bay 35-14.
The Bears made many errors and just couldn’t seem to do the right thing. Green Bay made it look easy and it really shouldn’t have been as easy as it was.
In a word, it was frustrating.
The following is a look at some of the observations made during the game and some critiques of the Bears’ performance. Granted, there was more bad than good but there may be at least one big positive thing that comes out of the loss that will help set the Bears in the right direction.
Glennon’s Decline and Removal
I said this in my story about the Steelers game HERE about Glennon looking pretty bad. Well, folks, he followed up last Sunday’s performance with a miserable game against the Packers. Sure, his stats don’t look terrible as he threw 33 passes completing 21 of those for 218 yards and a touchdown. But it was the two interceptions and two fumbles that did him in. That, coupled with his poor decision-making, pocket presence and mobility and Glennon showed us, once again, that he is not a starting NFL quarterback.
Glennon’s showing Thursday forced the Bears to bring in Mitchell Trubisky as their starter. A new era has begun in Chicago and we will hope it’s a good one. It is certainly necessary.
What Glennon has received in his contract, compared to what he has done for the Bears makes him look like a thief. Chicago paid him like a starting quarterback, he hasn’t delivered and is not what the Bears felt he could be. Perhaps Chicago’s offense didn’t fit Glennon’s style?
It’s likely more Glennon’s fault than anyone else’s’.
One thing is for sure and that is that the Bears weren’t going to win many games with Glennon at quarterback. And they may not win that many with Trubisky but the future is now.
Starting the rookie was the best thing for the Bears future and it was time for the Glennon era to end.
The Hit that Shook the World
By now, the hit that linebacker Danny Trevathan delivered on Thursday night has a been analyzed, replayed and talked about repeatedly. It’s almost old news. The most important thing is that Davante Adams not seriously injured. He is no longer in the hospital and is in the league’s concussion protocol.
We learned the other day that Trevathan was suspended for one game for the hit (it was reduced from two games).
Did he get what he deserved?
If you have seen the hit, it’s scary. I know people who had anxiety over the hit and it was difficult to watch for some. The hit appeared to be completely blatant and, in my opinion, it looked like it could have been avoided. Of course, it depends on who you talk to as to whether you think it could have been avoided.
And I am not a football player and cannot relate to how things happen in a moment like that. That being said, I am not an expert and I don’t claim to be an expert.
Most everyone seems to think the hit was blatant and that Trevathan got what he deserved. Some fans seem to think it was an avoidable hit.
The suspension puts the Bears in a bind. One of their best defensive players is going to be out for a game leaving the Bears thin at an already thin position. Chicago will now have to rely on guys like John Timu, Jonathan Anderson, and Christian Jones.
Hopefully, they will step up.
The Dynamic Duo
Much has been said about the impact that Jordan Howard and Tarik Cohen have had for the Bears. You can credit them for the Bears’ win against the Steelers. Also, despite the fact, the Bears lost big on Thursday Howard and Cohen piled up the yards.
The two have been the most positive aspect of the Bears’ offense so far.
There has been some concern that the Bears are going to wear Howard down by utilizing him so much. The evidence that he is getting beat up has been easy to see. Howard could hardly get up three times during the Steelers game and appeared to be hurt at least once in the Green Bay game.
It’s been reported that he has an AC joint sprain and that’s why we have been seeing him favoring his shoulder a bit this season.
With the Bears running Howard as much as they have been the question now becomes, how much longer will he last? And if he can’t go can Cohen run the ball consistently?
The answers are not long and no.
What we need to see is more of Benny Cunningham. He is the key. If the Bears can have him come in and spell the starters more often that will work wonders for the running game. We saw the coaching staff get Cunningham involved in the game Thursday night so they need to keep that up.
If they don’t, Chicago’s best running backs will fall apart; the running game will grind to a halt and Chicago will drop even deeper into the hole.
Quick Hits
There are just a few quick things I would like to say about the game and the Bears in general.
Strong safety Quintin Demps was put on injured reserve this past week. His play was disappointing anyway and it might have been only a matter of time before he got hurt. Now we wait to see if Adrian Amos can do anything special. He has yet to get an interception since coming into the league and that’s very disturbing.
I have talked about Pernell McPhee a lot since he came to Chicago. I have been critical of him but I am going to give him props for a fine performance against the Packers. With one sack and three tackles, McPhee is slowly starting to look like the player we hoped he would be when he came to Chicago
Hopefully, he will continue to improve and not get injured.
Leonard Floyd got out of the doghouse a bit as he got his first sack of the year Thursday night. There were some, including this writer, who felt Floyd could lead the NFL in sacks. That may not happen. He has been asked to drop into coverage a lot thanks to his speed so he is missing out on sacks that way. But Floyd is getting stymied at the line when trying to rush the passer.
There is still a lot of work Floyd needs to do to become an effective pass rusher.

The judge heard arguments last month in Subway's bid to have the suit dismissed.

",EU lawmakers give tentative nod to Brexit clearing law that could clobber Britain,"European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker addresses the European Parliament during a debate on The State of the European Union in Strasbourg, France, September 13, 2017. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann
LONDON (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers on Tuesday gave broad support to a law that could end the City of London’s global dominance in clearing euro-denominated financial contracts after Brexit.
The plan has raised hackles in Britain, where it threatens both job losses and tax revenues.
The draft EU law proposes that a foreign clearing house -- which stands between two sides of a transaction to ensure its smooth completion -- must be subject to more intense supervision by the bloc’s regulators if it wants to serve customers in the EU.
But if a clearing house is systemically important to the euro zone, then euro-denominated business with EU based customers must move to the bloc.
The draft law is anathema to Britain, which voted to leave the EU in a referendum last year.
It is home to LCH, an arm of the London Stock Exchange that clears most euro-denominated swaps in Europe. Financial services represent Britain’s biggest tax earning sector and the LSE has warned that thousands of jobs could leave the UK if euro clearing was forced out.
In the first debate in the European Parliament on Tuesday, lawmakers from the two biggest parties, the center right European People’s Party and the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, gave broad backing to the draft law, but called for some changes.
“It’s a good proposal from the European Commission,” Polish center-right MEP Danuta Huebner told parliament’s economic affairs committee.
“In principle, I support the proposal, which I find necessary,” added Roberto Gualtieri, an Italian center-left lawmaker who chairs the committee.
The European Parliament and EU states have final say on the reform, with changes expected during the approval process.
No timetable has been agreed for approving the law and, separately, there has been scant agreement on any new relationship between the EU and Britain.
That means LCH’s European customers don’t know at the moment if they can continue using the London clearer after Brexit.
Exploit this uncertainty, Frankfurt-based Eurex unveiled a “Brexit-proof” package of sweeteners on Monday to woo LCH customers.
BREXIT PROTECTIONISM
Huebner said parts of the draft law were too complex, creating uncertainty over how exactly EU regulators and the European Central Bank would decide when euro clearing conducted outside the bloc must move to the EU.
“We have to do everything to avoid potential inconsistency in decision-making,” Huebner said. “We must not politicize the whole process.”
Gualtieri said there was a need to “upgrade” EU supervision of clearing, but lawmakers should be “very cautious, reflective and in a listening mood” given the potential consequences.
Others said there was need to avoid protectionism or using clearing as a stick to beat Britain given that the UK was already “fighting with itself”.
Kay Swinburne, a British center-right lawmaker, a lone voice in outright opposition, said a regional restriction on a global currency is the wrong approach.
“There is a reason why we have done so much work at the global level, and I really hope that we are not going to throw all of that away to have some protectionism with regards to a Brexit decision,” Swinburne added.
Banks and the LSE have warned that forcing out some clearing would split markets and bump up costs for EU companies who use swaps to insure against adverse moves in borrowing costs, raw material prices, and currency swings.",1

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-senate-intel-committee-investigate-fake-news/story?id=50300272,Trump: Senate Intel Committee should investigate 'fake news',"President Donald Trump continued his attacks on the media today, suggesting in a tweet that the Senate Intelligence Committee should investigate news outlets for ""fake"" reporting.
Why Isn't the Senate Intel Committee looking into the Fake News Networks in OUR country to see why so much of our news is just made up-FAKE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2017
Trump has been railing against the media this week for its coverage of his trip to Puerto Rico and his relationship with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Trump zeroed in on NBC News, which reported Wednesday morning that Tillerson was on the verge of resigning in July and had called Trump a ""moron.""
The secretary of state, issuing a rare statement, shot down the report: ""I have never considered leaving this post.""
While in Las Vegas Wednesday, Trump said that he has ""total confidence in Rex"" and called the story ""phony"" and ""made up."" NBC News is standing by its reporting.
According to NBC News, tensions between Trump and Tillerson reached a peak when Trump delivered a politicized speech in July to the Boy Scouts of America, an organization Tillerson formerly led.
""[Tillerson], from my perspective, is in an incredibly frustrating place where...he ends up not being supported in a way that I would hope a secretary of state would be supported,"" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and is an ally of Tillerson's. Corker also said Tillerson is one of ""those people that help separate our country from chaos.""
After Tillerson said the U.S. has open lines of communication with North Korea, Trump undermined Tillerson by tweeting that Tillerson is ""wasting his time"" trying to negotiate with ""Little Rocket Man"" Kim Jong Un.
""Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!"" Trump tweeted over the weekend.
The Senate Intelligence Committee, another frequent target of Trump's attacks on Twitter, is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and any possible collusion with Trump campaign associates.
The committee's two top senators announced Wednesday that the ""issue of collusion"" between Russia and Trump campaign associates is still unresolved.",1

(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Trying to decide who you should start or sit this week? Let’s take a look at a few potential decisions owners have and try to sort through them:
Quarterbacks
Start – Carson Wentz – Philadelphia Eagles – vs. Arizona
After putting up 250 yards or less in each of the past two weeks, while throwing for 1 TD per week, it would be easy to ignore Wentz. The Cardinals are in the bottom half of the league in points allowed per week to opposing quarterbacks, and that’s despite facing the Colts and 49ers. That’s not to say that they aren’t a talented group, but at the same time Philadelphia will have an opportunity to produce through the air. Wentz will also be playing at home, where he played significantly better last season:
Home – 64.8% completion rate, 9 TD, 5 INT
Road – 60.4% completion rate, 7 TD, 9 INT
This would be a good opportunity to utilize Wentz, especially with the bye weeks causing trouble in setting our lineups.
Sit – Ben Roethlisberger – Pittsburgh Steelers – at Jacksonville
The Jaguars are giving up the fewest points per week against opposing quarterbacks, and that’s because they have been so porous against the run (third most points per week to opposing RB). That should mean another Le’Veon Bell-centric attack (he took 35 carries for 144 yards and 2 TD in Week 4), and limited chances for Roethlisberger to make big plays. He’s coming off a week where he threw for 216 yards and has a season high of 263 (back in Week 1). Throw in that he brings no value with his legs (7 carries for -5 yards) and unless you have no other alternatives the risk far outweighs the reward.
Running Backs
Start – Marshawn Lynch – Oakland Raiders – vs. Baltimore
Lynch has been a bit of a disappointment in his return to the NFL, averaging 3.4 yards per carry over his first four games and really limping as of late (15 carries for 30 yards over the past two weeks). Of course one of those games came against the dominant Denver defense, and Washington has been very good as well. Things are different for Week 5, where everything seems to be working in his favor:
The loss of Derek Carr should lead to more rushing attempts
Baltimore is traveling across the country
Baltimore has allowed the fifth most points per week to opposing RB, including the sixth most rushing yards (455 and 3 TD)
Start – Latavius Murray – Minnesota Vikings – at Chicago
The loss of Dalvin Cook should mean an opportunity for Murray, who draws a favorable matchup in his first start. While he’s still working his way back from his ankle injury and may not be at full strength, he should see the bulk of the early down/short yardage work. Against a Bears’ defense that’s allowed 4 rushing TD (tied for second most in the league), there’s a good chance that he hits the ground running. He’s not going to be a RB1, but he’s a viable RB2/must use FLEX option.
Sit – Andre Ellington – Arizona Cardinals – at Philadelphia
While it’s becoming obvious that Ellington is the best option in the Arizona backfield, that doesn’t necessarily mean that he’s going to get the bulk of the touches. He seems destined to share things with Chris Johnson, and while he saw 14 targets in Week 4 it’s hard to imagine that being replicated as the wide receiving corps gets healthy. Throw in that the Eagles have done a good job at stopping opposing running backs, including just 16 receptions, and Ellington is a FLEX option at best (and a riskier one at that).
Sit – D’Onta Foreman – Houston Texans – vs. Kansas City
Foreman has started eating into the touches of Lamar Miller, including 13 carries in Week 4, though he hasn’t been particularly productive. He has 34 carries for 114 yards (3.4 yards/carry) and managed just 2 receptions (and they came in the same game). The Chiefs also aren’t an ideal matchup, and with the potential for Deshaun Watson to be given more opportunities he’s an obvious sit.
Wide Receivers (Two-Receiver Formats)
Start – Devante Parker – Miami Dolphins – vs. Tennessee
While Parker has scored 1 TD in his first three games, he’s been targeted at least 8 times each week and has turned them into 69+ yards (18 receptions for 230 yards). Tennessee has allowed 8 TD to opposing wide receivers, most in the league (no one else has allowed more than 6), and Parker offers the most potential to find the end zone from Miami’s receiving corps. You could argue him as a borderline WR1.
Sit – Sammy Watkins – Los Angeles Rams – vs. Seattle
The Seahawks may not be the same defense that they once were, but they’ve still done a good job of shutting down opposing wide receivers. That alone would scare us off from Watkins, and despite the Rams offense coming together Watkins has been targeted twice in two of the four games (16 total targets) and only has one big day (106 yards and 2 TD in Week 3 against the 49ers). There’s far too much risk involved.
Wide Receivers (Three-Receiver Formats)
Start – Devin Funchess – Carolina Panthers – at Detroit
Kelvin Benjamin is banged up, and while he did play in Week 4 you still have to wonder if he will be limited. Funchess has often had issues with efficiency, but he’s coming off a day where he turned 9 targets into 7 receptions, 70 yards and 2 TD. We can’t expect the TD, but the opportunities should still be there against a defense that has allowed the eighth most receptions to opposing wide receivers through four weeks (51 receptions for 605 yards).
Sit – Marqise Lee/Allen Hurns – Jacksonville Jaguars – at Pittsburgh
The Jaguars offense is based around Leonard Fournette, with the team’s “top” two receivers combining for 29 receptions, 345 yards and 2 TD. Couple those uninspiring numbers with a road matchup against a defense that’s allowed the fourth fewest receptions to opposing wide receivers (35 for 339 yards and 2 TD) and this duo should be avoided.
Tight Ends
Start – Hunter Henry – Los Angeles Chargers – at New York Giants
He’s the epitome of a boom or bust player thus far, and also will have to contend with Antonio Gates who could syphon off some of the tight end opportunities. That said the Giants have been the worst defense against opposing tight ends, including 5 TD allowed. It’s only going to take one big play for Henry to register a usable performance, and there’s a good chance he provides more than just one.
Sit – Jack Doyle – Indianapolis Colts – vs. San Francisco
The 49ers have allowed 10 receptions and 77 yards to opposing tight ends this season. Combine that with some underwhelming performances from Doyle, who has a total of 43 yards over the past two weeks and 17 receptions, 163 yards and 0 TD overall, and this is an easy situation to avoid. Even with the bye weeks, there are better opportunities to try and exploit.

","With Christian Pulisic Driving, United States Steers Closer to World Cup","When Pulisic tore open the left side of the Panama defense 11 minutes later, slotting a cross that Altidore simply poked into the net, the game — 19 minutes old — seemed over. The cherry on top — an Altidore penalty kick, on a nervy chip after Bobby Wood had been cut down on a run into the area in the 42nd minute — erased all doubt.
The day had been saved.
After Wood added a fourth in the 63rd minute, the worries, the fears of the past few days, and the past few months, were gone. It had gone so well, in fact, that United States Coach Bruce Arena could even feign the tiniest bit of disappointment afterward.
“On the night, we actually didn’t finish well,” he said. “We could have scored a lot more goals.”
Panama Coach Hernán Darío Gómez would hardly disagree. “They could have had 10 goals,” he said in declaring the Americans “immensely superior” in every way in the match, and his team’s play as “muy, muy mal” — very, very bad.
The only concern of the Americans afterward, then, was for Pulisic, who was battered several times and then, finally, so badly that he required treatment after a particularly rough foul at midfield just after halftime.

Arena, realizing Pulisic’s unique value, and the fact that he may need a similar performance to close the deal on Tuesday, had seen enough. He substituted for Pulisic a few minutes later.
“He took a few shots,” Arena said. “And so we thought it was smart to get him off the field.”
Pulisic acknowledged the beating, a fact of his life that has become common in games against Concacaf opposition, and shrugged it off. “I got kicked a few times, but I’ll be fine,” he said.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
That may or may not be the case. After answering about a dozen questions from reporters, he slipped away while teammates took their turns with the news media. Moments later, far away from the scrum, Pulisic was limping noticeably.
He had done enough, though, to nearly push his team over the qualifying line.
The decisive 90 minutes will come on Tuesday, when the United States faces Trinidad and Tobago on the road. The Soca Warriors sit last in the group, their hopes long dashed and their pride potentially bruised depending on the result of a game at the group leader Mexico later Friday night. They would seem to have little motivation at this point other than to play spoiler.
That can be an attractive bit of motivation for small Concacaf teams, however, especially when there is a chance to ding the mighty United States. The Americans know that, and they know the stakes.
And if they have learned anything on their long qualifying road — one that began with two humbling losses and the firing of their last coach, Jurgen Klinsmann — it is that nothing is certain, and that even a country accustomed to a quadrennial World Cup trip has to earn its place on the field before it can pack its bags.
“The job is half-done,” defender Matt Besler said. “Now we have to go down there and do the rest.”",1

http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/02/technology/china-e-bikes-europe/index.html,China accused of flooding Europe with cheap e-bikes,"China has been accused of flooding Europe with hundreds of thousands of cheap electric bicycles.
Imports of Chinese e-bikes to Europe have increased from almost zero in 2010 to an estimated 800,000 in 2017, according to the European Bicycle Manufacturers Association.
The industry group has had enough: It filed a complaint with the European Commission on Monday that accuses Chinese manufacturers of dumping e-bikes into the European market at rock bottom prices.
The complaint argues that subsidies offered by the Chinese government allow its manufacturers to sell the e-bikes in Europe for less than they cost to produce.
Chinese e-bikes sell for as little as $450 in Europe, while local products typically cost $1,500 to $2,000.
E-bikes, which are powered by batteries, remain something of a novelty in Europe. But they're big business in China, where sales have skyrocketed from roughly 1 million a year in the early 2000s to more than 30 million in 2016.
Analysts estimate that there are now between 150 million and 200 million e-bikes on Chinese roads.
But sales growth in China has slowed in recent months because of a boom in bike-sharing schemes and a crackdown on electric bikes in some cities.
Excess production is now being shipped to Europe, according to the European Bicycle Manufacturers Association. It said the imports would ""annihilate European production within only a few years"" if action is not taken.
The association cited an economic planning document produced by the Chinese government that ""sets a clear 2020 goal that the 'export of electric bicycles will be dramatically increased.' ""
Related: This electric bicycle can go up to 40 mph
CNNMoney contacted several major Chinese e-bike manufacturers, but none responded to requests for comment.
Global e-bike sales are expected to increase from $15.7 billion in 2016 to $24.3 billion by 2025, according to Navigant Research.
Conventional Chinese bicycles have been subject to EU anti-dumping tariffs since the early 1990s.",1

","10 Important Stories From 09/26/17 Box Scores: Montgomery’s Strong Start, Harper’s Return & More","10 Important Stories From 09/26/17 Box Scores: Montgomery’s Strong Start, Harper’s Return & More
(Before It's News)
by Ray Kuhn
We had a busy Tuesday across baseball as the 2017 winds down. Whether you are making that final push towards a championship, getting ready for next season, or getting those last few days of DFS in, we have you covered. Let’s take a look at some of the performances that stood out from last night:
1) Hernandez Shows off the Power…
September is all about young players taking advantage of their chance. The trade from Houston gave Teoscar Hernandez that chance, and he is working towards a 2018 role with the Blue Jays. Batting lead-off, Hernandez went deep twice. His first home run was a solo shot off Chris Sale, and then followed it up with a three run blast. The problem though, is that in his other three at bats, Hernandez struck out. In 73 at bats with Toronto this season, Hernandez has seven home runs and 18 RBI while batting .274. His BABIP is .317, and it is very possible he holds onto his role for next season.
2) Cutch Has a Game…
We are past the point now of wondering if Andrew McCutchen is truly done or not, but last night ensured he is ending the season strong. Not only did the outfielder go 4 for 4 on Tuesday, but he went deep twice. His two home runs, a grand slam and a three run shot, gave him 28 on the season, and all together, the outfielder picked up 8 RBI on the night. That leaves McCutchen with 87 RBI on the season along with a .278 batting average. Sure there will lots of younger, more exciting and potential filled options on draft day, and you have to keep McCutchen’s early season struggles in mind, but he still has something to offer.
3) Montgomery Has a Strong Outing…
If your streaming carousel brought you to Jordan Montgomery last night, then you should be pleased. The rookie picked up his ninth victory of the season at home against Tampa Bay with six strong innings. Montgomery held the Rays to just one run in six innings of work on six hits and a walk. He struck out five while bringing his ERA down to 3.96 for the season. The Yankees’ plan for Montgomery next season will likely depend on how their off-season goes, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see him back in their rotation on a full time basis. He could prove to be a valuable mid, or back end of the rotation option if that is the case.
4) Rosario Continues to Slug…
Everyone is going to talk about Byron Buxton and Miguel Sano (before he got hurt), but there are more young players on the Twins who do require your attention. One of those players, is Eddie Rosario. The outfielder has been having a solid year, but when Sano went down, Rosario truly has stepped up. He went deep in the first inning last night, and followed that up with three more hits. After picking up 27th home run of the season, Rosario doubled twice (33 overall) and drove in two more runs. That brought his RBI total up to 78 to go along with his .292 batting average.
5) What Will Happen With Hader Next Year…
We know that Josh Hader was, maybe even still is, a top pitching prospect. The Brewers have given him a chance to start at the Triple-A level, but for multiple reasons, the southpaw has struggled and produced ERA’s north of five. Part of that reason, is that Milwaukee’s Triple-A team is in Colorado Springs so elevation is certainly an issue. However, the Brewers brought Hader to the major leagues this season to work out of the bullpen, and all he has done in his 34 outings is dominate. Last night, Hader picked up his second victory of the season with 2.2 innings of two run ball. In fact, all things considered this was one of his worst outings since he gave up two runs, but he did strikeout six as he saw his ERA jump to 1.93. Hader clearly can pitch at the big league level and get batters out, so it wouldn’t surprise me to see Milwaukee try him as a starter this spring. If not, we know he has value out of the bullpen.
6) Maybin Drives in Three…
The Astros didn’t get Cameron Maybin to sit on the bench, and while hitting for average has been a struggle this season, he is still a productive option. After his two hit night on Tuesday, Maybin is hitting just .225 on the season, but his .270 BABIP (career mark of .316) says this is on the lower scale of what we can expect from him. Maybin’s pop was on display last night, as he hit a traditional home run, a three run shot, and also as he he a triple to dead center field and scored on an error. In 386 at bats this season, Maybin has 10 home runs 34 RBI, and 33 stolen bases. In other words, he gives you just enough to keep you hooked from a fantasy perspective on his tools.
7) Harper Returns…
As far as fantasy owners are considered, this is too little, too late. Bryce Harper isn’t back to give their fantasy teams a push in the final week of the season. Instead, Harper is back to get a few games and at bats in before the playoffs. The good thing though, is that we are going to get proof that Harper is healthy and recovered from his injury prior to next season. In reality, Harper’s injury looked worse than it was, but it was still a good thing to see the outfielder back on the field. In three at bats prior to being replaced, Harper went 0 for 2 with a walk and a strikeout. Check the lineup each day before starting him, as Washington will be careful.
8) Anderson Shuts Out Miami…
After struggling and missing a chunk of the season, Tyler Anderson is back, and last night showed why there was some buzz surrounding the southpaw this season. Now that outlook is always going to be clouded by the fact that Anderson does pitch at Coors Field, but early in his career, he has shown some potential. Last night, Anderson shut the Marlins out over seven innings of work while allowing just four hits and striking out five. On the season, Anderson’s ERA is 4.81 in 17 games (15 starts). Anderson made his fourth start since returning for the disabled list on Tuesday, and in that stretch, he has a 1.19 ERA along with a 0.79 WHIP. In two starts in Coors Field since his return, Anderson has thrown 13 shutout innings, and he is worth a look.
9) Another One for JD…
This is getting to be insane. Originally acquired to protect Paul Goldschmidt in the batting order, J.D. Martinez is taking control of things for Arizona’s offense. All Martinez did last night, was pick up three hits in four at bats. He was a triple short of the cycle, and Martinez’s night included his 44th home run of the season, which happened to be a grand slam. Martinez drove in six runs on the night which brought his total for the season to 103 as he raised his batting average to .304. Arizona certainly has agreed with Martinez, and it will be interesting to see where he ends up this off-season.
10) Seager Drives in Four…
It hasn’t been an easy September for the Dodgers as they came crashing back to earth. Corey Seager has battled an elbow injury, but it didn’t appear to impact him at the plate on Tuesday. The shortstop went deep for the 21st time this season, a three run shot, and he later added an RBI single (75 for the season). While Seager is having a solid season, some would consider his overall numbers a disappointment; although he is batting .295. It was a good sign to see Seager’s success last night, as he is hitting just .195 in 68 at bats so far in September. It is possible, that Seager might be a “value” pick for 2018 since he didn’t take as big a step forward as other young players; such as Francisco Lindor.

",from heart attack to further hockey history?,"Media playback is not supported on this device I was worried my kids may not have a dad – Kerry on heart attack
It was 3am in Johannesburg, on Saturday, 15 July and GB women's hockey head coach Danny Kerry was not only awake, but in pain - ""a lot of pain"".
Sleepless nights are not uncommon for Olympic gold medal-winning master tacticians like Kerry - particularly during an event like the World League Semi-Finals in South Africa, which the team were midway through competing in.
But rather than contemplate how to follow up their 1-0 defeat of Germany just hours earlier, he was about to begin the biggest off-field fight of his life.
Kerry had tried to ignore a growing pain in his chest and left arm for two hours - telling himself 'you don't feel like you're going to die', but he grew increasingly concerned as the discomfort failed to subside.
A call to the GB team doctor - Cath Lester - followed and he was soon admitted into hospital, where tests confirmed the 46-year-old had suffered a heart attack.
""Prior to surgery it was pretty scary and I did have a particularly dark moment thinking, 'what will happen, will I come out of this?'"" Kerry told BBC Sport.
""I was really concerned about my immediate family, my wife Lisa, the two kids - Anna and Orla - and whether they'd have a dad.""
In a wide-ranging interview Kerry reveals how his condition came as a ""massive shock"" but that now - after returning to full-time work last week - he feels he can lead the British women to a defence of their Olympic crown at Tokyo 2020.
Kerry a cardiac ward 'freak show'
Several of the GB team were allowed to visit Kerry in hospital before he returned to the UK
After arrival in hospital Kerry required two separate blood tests before the heart attack was confirmed, while a separate angiogram diagnosed a blocked artery as the cause.
He spent three days in intensive care where his condition was stabilised before being offered the option to return to the UK for surgery or to have the procedure in South Africa.
""Initially I wanted to go back home to be with my family, but I was advised that statistically it [the survival rate] was better not to delay,"" said Kerry, who's wife was flown out to be with him before the procedure.
He did manage a video call to his children - who were four and six at the time - back in the UK, but said ""trying to make it a positive environment for them"" was one of the hardest moments of his life.
""It was really tough because you're putting on a very brave face for them and trying to smile and laugh when you're not feeling like it so much,"" he said.
Five days after being admitted to hospital Kerry was fitted with three metal 'stents' in his heart, but he began impressing the doctors from the moment he woke who were astounded by his rapid recovery.
""I was a bit of a freak show in the cardiac care unit in Johannesburg as they kept coming and checking on this young guy who looks on the surface really healthy,"" said the Bisham-based coach.
""The consultant told me 'you're as fit as a fiddle, you've come through this really well' - so the whole situation seemed as much of a shock to them as it was to me.""
To further boost his morale several of the GB team were allowed to visit him in hospital before he returned to the UK.
While Kerry had been criticised for his 'grumpy' attitude towards the British players during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, he had taken on board the ""harrowing"" feedback and over the following eight years become a much-loved coach.
""It was a brilliant moment because I wasn't a hockey coach anymore, it was just people looking out for one another,"" said Kerry, who guided the GB women to their first hockey gold at Rio 2016.
Olympic champion Susannah Townsend was part of the British squad competing in South Africa, but was unable to attend the hospital as she was suffering from a cold and wanted to minimise the risk of Kerry developing illness.
""I've known him for 13 years so it was a real shock for us all and really difficult for me personally,"" said the player after the team finished third at the World League Semi-Finals.
""Danny didn't want his situation to be a distraction during the event and he didn't want us to 'win for him' but it was in the back of our minds.""
The 'new' Danny Kerry
Kerry changed his diet after his surgery, with the help of Kate Richardson-Walsh
Why the relatively fit - and regular cyclist - Kerry suffered a heart attack is still relatively unclear, but the coach has attempted to transform some elements of his life to minimise the stresses which potentially played a role in the condition.
""The health service here have been brilliant but are still a bit bemused because my risk factor for something like this is incredible low,"" said Kerry, who has lost more than 6kg since surgery.
""I've had time to reflect on my life and work over the last couple of months and I'm now incredibly fastidious about what I eat - I don't touch anything with any saturated fat in it at all.""
Olympic gold medal-winning hockey captain Kate Richardson-Walsh, who retired after the team's historic gold in Rio, helped facilitate that change with a special delivery for Kerry.
""I managed to get a whole package of Quorn sent to him to make sure he was eating healthily,"" said Richardson-Walsh, who describes learning of Kerry's heart attack as ""horrendous"".
""He would go out on runs during tournaments so he was relatively fit, but he's lost so much weight now and his diet has really changed so hopefully he can look after his physical and mental wellbeing going forwards.""
Kerry's children Anna and Orla have provided some light relief during his rehabilitation and transition into his 'new life'.
Kerry's children Anna and Orla have provided some light relief during his rehabilitation and transition into his 'new life'
""They know that I'm very diligent about what I eat now, so they'll be eating sausages and I'll be looking on enviously and my seven-year-old [Anna] goes 'sorry Daddy but I like sausages and I know you can't eat them' so there are funny moments,"" he said.
""Another time my four-year-old [Orla] was lying on my chest, giving me a cuddle and then jumps off, laughs and runs to the kitchen and goes 'mummy, mummy, daddy's heart isn't beating properly'.
""It was kind of funny and then not funny at the same time.""
Enjoying family time is something Kerry says he now cherishes and appreciates much more.
""I spent my entire life looking backwards and looking forwards, never living in the moment,"" he says, when referring to how he hardly celebrated gold in Rio before contemplating a new challenge for the squad.
""I look back at how I've been out for nice meals with friends and family and on the surface it may look like I've been present, but in my head I'm thinking about things that have happened [in games] and about what I'm going to do next.
""I needed to change elements of that and make my life a bit more healthy.""
Why continue?
GB women won a first Olympic hockey gold medal at Rio 2016, beating the Netherlands 2-0 in a penalty shootout
After achieving the sport's ultimate prize of Olympic gold - on top of previous European, Commonwealth and World League honours - Kerry could have been forgiven from walking away from the sport to focus on his health.
However, he is arguably more determined than ever to continue making history with the GB women's hockey team.
""It's really hard for some people to get their head around, but it isn't a job,"" says Kerry, who has transformed the fortunes of the squad since taking over in 2005.
""Yes you take a salary home but that's not the reason you do it - it's because of you're passionate about it and are surrounded by staff and athletes who want the best as well.""
It may be fewer than three months since his surgery, but after working two days per week for the past month Kerry has now returned to full-time coaching with the GB team.
The squad are about to head into their busiest period outside of the Olympic year, with the World League Finals in New Zealand in November followed by the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in Australia, in April.
The GB women will then return to the scene of their 2012 Olympic bronze medal-winning success as London hosts the World Cup from next July.
Does more history beckon in Tokyo?
Kerry takes daily medication to keep the metalwork in his heart ""in-check"" while he hopes cycling frequently as well as yoga and meditation will help 'reduce the stresses' at future events.
Having missed the team's European bronze campaign in August, while recovering from surgery, Kerry is eager to return to a ""competitive tournament environment"" and believes his new-look squad have ""amazing potential"".
""For me personally the next challenge after winning a [Olympic] gold medal is to do something even more special and achieve it again,"" says Kerry, who will have regular health check-ups in the years ahead.
""I have a really great life and a great opportunity to try for the even bigger challenge of winning again.""",1

By Sam Bocetta
The answer is yes.
The recent news that Amazon is giving refunds to huge numbers of people who fear they might have bought fake glasses for viewing the solar eclipse has thrown a spotlight on the fact that Amazon is full of fake products. Have even a quick glance at the process – or rather the lack of one – that Amazon uses to vet sellers, and this will come as no surprise.
However, the rise of fake products on Amazon causes some confusion among free-market liberals like myself. I have no problem with people selling stuff, of course, and think they should be free to do so without government interference.
That said, I’m forced to admit that in some cases, government guidelines should be respected, and Amazon should do more to crack down on unscrupulous sellers.
This is especially true when it comes to items bought to be used with firearms. Amazon is full of “fake” – for which read “cheap Chinese copy” – holsters, ear protection, and even gunsmithing tools.
For a lot of products, buying cheaper Chinese copies of American-designed items is not a huge problem. After all, they are cheaper, and the majority of things we buy do not need to “perform” in hostile environments.
For gun accessories, however, things are different. Guns are, let us remember, inherently dangerous devices, and if your holster fails you run the risk of your weapon falling out, and shooting yourself in the leg. To take another example, the government mandates that protective hearing devices sold for shooting need an ANSI certificate. Without this, there is no way of knowing that the ear protection you are buying will actually protect you, and you could damage your hearing before you realize you have bought a fake.
The Scale Of The Problem
The scale of this problem is huge. Reliable numbers are hard to come by because of course, Amazon tries to keep it out of the public domain. However, some independent reports suggest that up to 70% of the items sold by third-party sellers on Amazon are fake. That’s right, 70%.
These items are typically bought on Chinese versions of Amazon, such as AliBaba, where Chinese knock-offs of Western brands are rife. Third-party sellers then list them on Amazon, sometimes with misleading descriptions that make them appear legitimate.
The problem has grown so large because a lot of these listings fall into a legal gray area. In outright copyright infringement is proven, then Amazon can take action and remove fake items. However, in many cases sellers are clever about listing fake items in ways that do not fall foul of copyright law. In these instances, Amazon can do nothing.
Amazon’s defense here is that they are merely facilitating people buying and selling products between themselves. In the absence of gross copyright violations, therefore, the responsibility for spotting fake products lies with the consumer. That’s you.
What Is To Be Done?
As I said above, stories like this create something of a moral quandary for me. I think that people should be free to buy and sell whatever they want, without the interference of the government. And, I have to admit, that right should extend to “fake” items.
Ultimately, I think that these poor-quality products should be allowed to compete with American-made ones. In that spirit, and though some people are calling for it, I do not think that Amazon should interfere in this matter.
This leaves us, the consumers, with the responsibility for spotting fake products, and not buying them. For most people, this should not be too difficult, because there are a few key things to look out for.
The first, pretty obviously, is the price. If a product is listed on Amazon for 50% of the price it normally retails at, it is probably a Chinese copy. If a seller has a low rating, which on Amazon means less than 3.5 stars, then it’s likely they have had complaints in the past. Also look out for the seller’s name – if they are listed as “generic”, and not the name of the company who produces the item, they could be a fake seller.
Of course, my belief in the free market also extends to you, the buyer. You are free to buy these “fake” items if you like, and for some people, the reduced cost of them can make them a legitimate option. I would just say that, when buying accessories for shooting, respect the fact that you are using a deadly weapon, and buy your accessories accordingly.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-drones-exclusive/exclusive-game-of-drones-u-s-poised-to-boost-unmanned-aircraft-exports-idUSKBN1CG0F4
",Exclusive - Game of Drones: U.S. poised to boost unmanned aircraft exports,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is nearing completion of new “Buy American” rules to make it easier to sell U.S.-made military drones overseas and compete against fast-growing Chinese and Israeli rivals, senior U.S. officials said.
While President Donald Trump’s aides work on relaxing domestic regulations on drone sales to select allies, Washington will also seek to renegotiate a 1987 missile-control pact with the aim of loosening international restrictions on U.S. exports of unmanned aircraft, according to government and industry sources.
At home, the U.S. administration is pressing ahead with its revamp of drone export policy under heavy pressure from American manufacturers and in defiance of human rights advocates who warn of the risk of fueling instability in hot spots including the Middle East and South Asia.
The changes, part of a broader effort to overhaul U.S. arms export protocols, could be rolled out by the end of the year under a presidential policy decree, the administration officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
The aim is to help U.S. drone makers, pioneers in remote-controlled aircraft that have become a centerpiece of counterterrorism strategy, reassert themselves in the overseas market where China, Israel and others often sell under less-cumbersome restrictions.
Simplified export rules could easily generate thousands of jobs, but it’s too early to be more specific, said Remy Nathan, a lobbyist with the Aerospace Industry Association. The main beneficiaries would be top U.S. drone makers General Atomics, Boeing (BA.N), Northrop Grumman (NOC.N), Textron (TXT.N) and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N).
“This will allow us to get in the game in a way that we’ve never been before,” said one senior U.S. official.
‘BUY AMERICAN’ AGENDA
Regulations are expected to be loosened especially on the sale of unarmed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drones, the most sophisticated of which carry high-resolution cameras and laser-guided targeting systems to aid missiles fired from warplanes, naval vessels or ground launchers.
Deliberations have been more complicated, however, on how to alter export rules for missile-equipped drones like the Predator and Reaper. Hunter-killer drones, which have essentially changed the face of modern warfare, are increasingly in demand and U.S. models considered the most advanced.
The push is not only part of Trump‘s “Buy American” agenda to boost U.S. business abroad but also reflects a more export-friendly approach to weapons sales that the administration sees as a way to wield influence with foreign partners, the senior official said.
Under a draft of the new rules, a classified list of countries numbering in double digits would be given more of a fast-track treatment for military drone purchases, a second senior official said. The favored group would include some of Washington’s closest NATO allies and partners in the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence alliance: Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, according to the industry source.
Rachel Stohl, director of the conventional defense program at the Stimson Center in Washington, said if U.S. drone export rules become too lenient, they could give more governments with poor human rights records the means to “target their own civilians.”
Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, revised the policy for military drone exports in 2015. But U.S. manufacturers complained it was still too restrictive compared with main competitors China and Israel.

U.S. drone makers are vying for a larger share of the global military drone market. Even before the coming changes, the Teal Group, a market research firm, has forecast sales will rise from $2.8 billion in 2016 to $9.4 billion in 2025.
Linden Blue, CEO of privately held General Atomics, the U.S. leader in military drones, visited the White House recently to lobby for his industry, a person familiar with the discussions said.
Among the U.S. changes will be a formal reinterpretation of the “presumption of denial”, a longstanding obstacle to most military drones sales, that would make it easier and faster to secure approval, the officials said.
Britain, and only recently Italy, are the only countries that had been allowed to buy armed U.S. drones.
A long-delayed $2 billion sale to India of General Atomics’ Guardian surveillance drones finally secured U.S. approval in June. But New Delhi’s request for armed drones has stalled.
A major hurdle to expanded sales of the most powerful U.S. drones is the Missile Technology Control Regime, or MTCR, a 1987 accord signed by the United States and 34 other countries, which set rules for the sale and purchase of missiles.
It categorizes drones with a range greater than of 185 miles (300 km) and a payload above 1,100 pounds (500 kg) as cruise missiles, requiring extremely tight import/export controls. To gain an international stamp of approval for the relaxed U.S. export rules, U.S. officials want the MTCR renegotiated.
State Department officials attending an annual meeting of the missile-control group in Dublin next week will present a “discussion paper” proposing that sales of drones – which did not exist when the agreement was created – be treated more leniently than the missile technology that the MTCR was designed to regulate, according to a U.S. official and industry sources.
There is no guarantee of a consensus. Russia, which has NATO members along its borders, could resist such changes, the U.S. official said.
CHINA AND ISRAEL
China, which is not an MTCR signatory, has pushed ahead with drone sales to some countries with close ties to Washington, such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria, but which have failed to pass U.S. regulatory muster.
Chinese models such as the CH-3 and CH-4 have been compared to the Reaper but are much cheaper. U.S. officials said Beijing sells them with few strings attached.
The Chinese foreign ministry insists it takes a “cautious and responsible attitude” to military drone exports.
Israel, which is outside the MTCR but has pledged to abide by it, competes with U.S. manufacturers on the basis of high-tech standards. But it will not sell to neighbors in the volatile Middle East. Israel sold $525 million worth of drones overseas in 2016, according defense ministry data.
U.S. drone makers and their supporters within the administration contend that other countries are going to proliferate drones, so they should not be left behind.",1

",Credit Agency Equifax Threatened To Pay Up In Bitcoin Or Else,"By Aaron Kesel
Credit reporting agency Equifax was hacked, potentially endangering 143 million Americans’ social security numbers, birth dates, and other private information. Unless, according to the alleged hackers who hacked them, Equifax pays the 600 BTC ransom (2.6 million dollars) by September 15th, according to a Darkweb onion site.
The supposed hackers note that they won’t publicly post credit card numbers of the credit agency, suggesting they may pawn them on Darkweb carding forums.
“We are two people trying to solve our lives and those of our families,” the group explains. “We did not expect to get as much information as we did, nor do we want to affect any citizen. But we need to monetize the information as soon as possible.”
The hackers appear to have a sense of humor, and how they arrived at that amount is even funnier. Here’s how they claimed to have arrived at the number.
“Three Equifax executives sold 3 million dollars in shares taking advantage of their insider information after the attack,” notes the site. “We believe that 600 BTC is a fair amount.”

The retail giant isn’t the only business to have been affected by a financial breach. Target was also the “target” one year prior which cost the company an estimated $252 million, according to SEC filings.
If this threat is legitimate, which the hackers warn they can prove, it is up to Equifax whether nearly half of America may have their private data leaked on the Internet September 15th.
“Request a specific part or a specific data from an email that corresponds to Equifax and we will send it to you,” The hackers said.
The irony of this is if the credit agency or any of these businesses dealt in cryptocurrency in the first place they wouldn’t be dealing with this problem because crypto lacks a pull method; you can not automatically withdraw without the wallet owner’s consent, and it also does not label each wallet with its users personal details. Instead, you have a string of numbers and letters that identify each user as a wallet address that can only send or receive cryptocurrency.
